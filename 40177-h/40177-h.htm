<h1>THE CARTER GIRLS.</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="f8">THE CARTERS.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Helen, the doctor ought to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he ought to know, but does he
know? If doctors agreed among themselves, I&rsquo;d
have more use for them. A poor patient has
to submit to having everything the doctors are
interested in for the time being. A specialist
can always find you suffering with his specialty.
Didn&rsquo;t old Dr. Davis treat Father for malaria
because he himself, forsooth, happened to be born
in the Dismal Swamp, got malaria into his system
when he was a baby and never got it out?
All his patients must have malaria, too, because
Dr. Davis has it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Helen, that is so, but you see Father&rsquo;s
symptoms <em>were</em> like malaria in a way,&rdquo; and Douglas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Carter could not help laughing at her sister,
although she well knew that the last doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis
of her father&rsquo;s case was no laughing
matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and then the next one, that bushy-whiskered
one with his stomach pump and
learned talk of an excess of hydrochlorics! Of
course he found poor dear Daddy had a stomach,
though he had never before been aware of it.
All the Carters are such ostriches&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are if we blindly bury our heads in
the sand and refuse to see that this last doctor
is right, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant ostrich stomachs and not brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shhh! Here come the children! Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t
talk about it before them yet. They&rsquo;ll have to
know soon enough.&rdquo; And Douglas, the eldest
of the five Carters, tried to smooth her troubled
brow and look as though she and Helen had been
discussing the weather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know what? I&rsquo;m going, too, if it&rsquo;s a movie,&rdquo;
declared Lucy, a long-legged, thirteen-year-old
girl who reminded one of nothing so much as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
thorough-bred colt&mdash;a colt conscious of its legs
but meaning to make use of those same legs to
out-distance all competitors in the race to be run
later on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s movies,&rdquo; said Nan, the fifteen-year-old
sister, noting the serious expression
of Douglas&rsquo;s usually calm countenance. &ldquo;I
believe something has happened. Is it Bobby?&rdquo;
That was the very small brother, the joy and torment
of the whole family.</p>

<p>The Carters formed stair steps with a decided
jump off at the bottom. Douglas was eighteen;
Helen, seventeen; Nan, fifteen; Lucy, thirteen;
and then came a gap of seven years and Bobby,
who had crowded the experiences of a lifetime
into his six short years, at least the life-long experiences
of any ordinary mortal. He was always
having hair-breadth escapes so nearly serious
that his family lived in momentary terror
of each being the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not Bobby,&rdquo; said Douglas gravely.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But nothing serious! Not Daddy!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the two younger girls and both of them looked
ready for tears. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the new doctor cure
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he thinks he can, but it is going to be up
to us to help,&rdquo; and Douglas drew Lucy and Nan
down on the sofa beside her while Helen stopped
polishing her pretty pink nails and planted herself
on an ottoman at her feet. &ldquo;All of you must
have noticed how thin Father is getting and how
depressed he is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! Not a bit like himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t malaria, as Dr. Davis thought;
and it wasn&rsquo;t stomach trouble, as Dr. Drew
thought; and the surgeon&rsquo;s X-ray could not
show chronic appendicitis, as Dr. Slaughter
feared,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feared, indeed!&rdquo; sniffed Helen. &ldquo;Hoped, you
mean!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this new nerve specialist that comes
here from Washington, so highly recommended&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he was doing so well in Washington, why
did he come to Richmond?&rdquo; interrupted the scornful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Helen, doubtful as usual of the whole medical
fraternity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, honey, but if he can help
Father, we should be glad he did come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If, indeed! Another barrel of tonics and
bushel of powders, I suppose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! This new man, Dr. Wright, says
&lsquo;no medicine at all.&rsquo; Now this is where we come
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind, Helen, Douglas says &lsquo;come in,&rsquo; not &lsquo;butt
in,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Lucy pertly. &ldquo;You interrupt so much
that Nan and I don&rsquo;t know yet what&rsquo;s the matter
with Daddy and how we are to help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;s interrupting now? I haven&rsquo;t
said a word for half an hour at least,&rdquo; said
Helen brazenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, what&rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo; which was Carter talk
for saying, &ldquo;You are fibbing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re another!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls, girls, this is not helping. It&rsquo;s just being
naughty,&rdquo; from the eldest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, Douglas, don&rsquo;t mind them. Helen and
Lucy would squabble over their crowns and harps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in Heaven,&rdquo; said the peace-loving Nan. And
the joke of squabbling in Heaven restored order,
and Douglas was able to go on with what she
had to tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright says it is a case of nervous prostration
and that a complete change is what Father
needs and absolute rest from business. He
thinks a sea trip of two months, and a year in
the country are absolutely essential.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will that make him all the way well?&rdquo;
asked Helen. &ldquo;If it does, I&rsquo;ll take off my yachting
cap to this Dr. Wright as having some sense,
after all. I mean to have a lovely new yachting
suit for the trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was by all odds the most stylish member
of the family, and, some thought, the beauty;
but others preferred the more serene charm of
Douglas, who was a decided blonde with Titian
hair and complexion to match. Helen&rsquo;s hair was
what she scornfully termed a plain American
brown, neither one thing nor the other, but it was
abundant and fine and you may be sure it was
always coiffed in the latest twist.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Nan had soft dark curls and dreamy dark eyes
and spoke with a drawl. She did not say much,
but when she did speak it was usually to say
something worth listening to.</p>

<p>Lucy was as yet too coltish to classify, but she
had a way of carrying her bobbed head with its
shock of chestnut hair and tilting her pretty
little pointed chin which gave her sisters to understand
that she intended to have her innings
later on, but not so very much later on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new yachting suit! Just listen to Helen!
Always got to be dressing up!&rdquo; declared Lucy,
ever ready for battle with the second sister. &ldquo;I
should think you would blush,&rdquo; and, indeed,
Helen&rsquo;s face was crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I did not mean to forget Father, but if
I have to have a new suit, I just thought I would
have it appropriate for the sea trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to learn how to climb like a sailor,&rdquo;
from Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a chest full of poetry to
read on the voyage,&rdquo; from Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, girls, girls! We are not to go,&mdash;just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Father and Mother! The way we are to help is
to stay at home and take care of ourselves and
Bobby. How do you think Father could get any
rest with all of us tagging on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not go! Douglas Carter, you are off your
bean! How could we get along without Mother
and Father and how under Heaven could they
get along without us? What does Mother say?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t said anything yet. The doctor is
still with Father. Dr. Wright says Father must
have quiet and no discussions going on around
him. He says every one must be cheerful and
arrangements must be made for the trip without
saying a word to Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mother to make them?&rdquo; drawled Nan, and
everybody laughed.</p>

<p>It was an excruciating joke to expect Mrs.
Carter to make a move or take the initiative in
anything. Her rôle was ever to follow the course
of least resistance, and up to this time that course
had led her only by pleasant places. Like some
pretty little meadow stream she had meandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
through life, gay and refreshing, if shallow withal,
making glad the hearts of many just by her
pleasant sweetness; but no one had expected any
usefulness from her, so she had given none.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, fresh from the laurels of a
brilliant winter, her debutante year in New Orleans,
the beautiful Miss Sevier had taken the
White Sulphur by storm. Only one figure at one
German had been enough to show Robert Carter
that she was the only girl for him; and as
he was the type that usually got what he started
out to get, and also was by all odds the best looking
young man at the White, besides being a
very promising architect who had plenty of work
waiting for him in Richmond, Annette Sevier
naturally succumbed to his wooing, and in three
weeks&rsquo; time their engagement was announced.
She was an exquisite girl, a Creole beauty of a
daintiness and charm that appealed to every fibre
of Bob Carter&rsquo;s being. She had been a beautiful
girl and was still a beautiful woman; under forty,
she looked more like the elder sister of her great
girls than like their mother.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess to Bobby,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;and maybe
to Lucy, although her long legs make me a
little doubtful of her being really mine&mdash;but you
other girls, you must be changelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert Carter had worked hard to keep his
dainty love in all the comforts that she needed.
I will not say expected or demanded,&mdash;she did
neither of those disagreeable or ungraceful
things. Comfort and elegance were just necessary
to her environment and one could no more
accuse her of selfishness than tax a queen for
receiving homage.</p>

<p>If a dainty, elegant wife with no idea that
money was more than something to spend takes
hard work to keep, surely four growing girls
with the extravagant ideas of the young persons
of the day meant redoubled and tripled labour.
Then there was Bobby! It took still more money
to furnish him with all the little white linen
sailor suits that his doting mother considered
necessary for him. She thought nothing of having
two dozen made up at one time, and those
of the purest and finest linen. Bob, Sr., looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
over the bill for those same two dozen suits, did
have a whimsical thought that with all that equipment
it would be gratifying if just once he could
see Bob, Jr., clean; but the only way to see Bobby
clean was to lie in wait for him on the way from
the bath; then and then only was he clean.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, Robert Carter accepted
the bills as part of the day&rsquo;s work. If they were
larger than usual, then he would just work a little
harder and get more money. An inborn horror
of debt kept him out of it. He had all the orders
he could fill and was singularly successful in
competitive designs. His health had always been
perfect and his energy so great that action was
his normal state.</p>

<p>And now what was this thing that had come
upon him? A strange lassitude that made it almost
impossible for him to get up in the morning,
a heaviness of limbs and an irascibility that was
as foreign to him as weakness. It had been going
on for several weeks and he had run the
gamut of doctors, impatient of their failures.
They agreed on only one thing and that was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he must rest. How could he rest? Weren&rsquo;t
there five pairs of legs demanding silk stockings
(even Lucy insisted that her lean shanks be
clothed in the best)? Suits and hats must be
bought with each change of season for the whole
family, shirtwaists and shoes, lingerie of the
finest. It took four servants besides the chauffeur
to run their establishment. Their butcher&rsquo;s
bills were only equalled by the dairy bills, their
grocery bills by their gasoline. &ldquo;Rest, indeed!
They might as well tell Uncle Sam to rest,&rdquo; said
the sick man to himself. &ldquo;Who is going to pay
for the silk stockings if I rest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor had come, the last one on his list of
doctors, a young man from Washington, a nerve
specialist. He had asked him quite seriously if
he had had any hallucinations, seen things he
could not quite account for, and Carter had answered
somewhat grimly: &ldquo;Silk stockings and
French chops!&rdquo; And the doctor, being a very
knowing young man, had understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Carter, any one in your run-down
nervous condition is apt to brood over fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
troubles until it is not uncommon for him
to be in a measure delirious. Now I am going
to be quite frank with you, which is a course not
usually pursued by nerve specialists but one I
feel to be wisest. You have presumed on your
strength and endurance for many years. Physically
you have stood the test, but your nerves,
which are in a way the mind or soul of the
muscles and organs, have at last rebelled, and
now you are going to have to submit to inactivity
for at least a year&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A year! My God, man, you are crazy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a year. Would not that be better than
going to pieces completely and living on, a useless
hulk? There, I thought that would make
you sit up. Why should you not rest? What is
eating you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright had a very brusque manner which
was, indeed, in keeping with his appearance. He
was a stalwart, broad-shouldered man, considerably
under thirty. His face, rough-hewn but
not heavy, was redeemed from plainness by the
bluest blue eyes that were ever seen, with exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
long black lashes. His teeth were good
but his rather long upper lip did not disclose the
fact except on the rare occasions when he
laughed. He had more control over his mouth
than his eyes, as his eyes laughed continually
whether he would or no. His brows were heavy
and shaggy and he had a trick of pulling them
down over his eyes as though he wanted to have
his little laugh to himself, since those eyes would
laugh. There was no laugh in his eyes now,
but rather a stern kindness as he slangily invited
the confidence of the older man, his
patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eating me? Why, money, of course. I have
absolutely nothing but what I earn,&mdash;and look at
my family! They have always had everything
I could give them and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now they must wake up and pay for their
beds of ease,&rdquo; said the physician grimly. &ldquo;Have
you no property?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I own the house we live in; at least I
almost own it. If a shoemaker&rsquo;s children do go
barefoot, an architect does build and own the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
house he lives in,&rdquo; and the sick man managed to
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! Any other property?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a side of a mountain in Albemarle
County. I took it for a bad debt from a country
store-keeper&mdash;a kind of miser&mdash;but I believe I&rsquo;d
rather have the debt, as at least I had no taxes
to pay on the debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carter and Dr. Wright were alone during
this conversation as Mrs. Carter had left the
room to endeavor to compose herself. The little
meadow brook had struck a rocky bed at last and
its shallow waters were troubled. What was to
become of her? Her Bob ill! Too ill to be worried
about anything! And this beetle browed
young doctor scared her with his intent gaze;
there was no admiration or homage in it, only a
scarcely veiled disapproval. She felt like a poor
little canary with a great Tom-cat peering at
her, scorning her as too insignificant even for a
mouth-full. And how was it her fault that she
was so useless? Was it the canary&rsquo;s fault that
he had been born in a cage and some one took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
care of him and he had never had to do like other
birds and grub for his living? She was just
about as capable of doing what this Dr. Wright
expected of her as the canary would have been
had he told the bird to come out of his cage and
begin not only to grub worms for himself but
for the kind person who had always fed him and
maybe for the family as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carter,&rdquo; said Dr. Wright, trying evidently
not to be too stern as the little woman fluttered
back into the room, a redness about her eye-lids
and a fresh sprinkling of powder on her
pretty nose, &ldquo;I want your husband to give you
power of attorney so you can transact any business
for him that is necessary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? Oh, Dr. Wright, not me! I can&rsquo;t write
a check and don&rsquo;t know how to do sums at all.
Couldn&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas will do,&rdquo; feebly muttered the invalid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Douglas your son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! She is our eldest daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange how you Virginians, with the
most womanly women I know of anywhere, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
constantly giving them masculine names. Shall
I ask Miss Douglas to come to you?&rdquo; Dr. Wright
was evidently for early action and meant to push
his point without more ado.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doctor, couldn&rsquo;t you see her first and tell
her what it is you want? I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Carter, if you wish it. And now I
must ask you to keep your husband very quiet, no
talking, no discussions, sleep, if he can get it, and
very nourishing food. I will write out what I
want him to eat and will ask you to see that he
gets it and gets it on schedule time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor little canary! The time has come for
you to begin to grub!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="f8">POWER OF ATTORNEY.</span></h2>


<p>When Dr. Wright entered the library where
the four girls were holding their consultation, he
thought that without doubt they made a very
charming group. But his soul was wroth within
him at womenkind who could let a man like the
one he had just left upstairs slave himself almost
into insensibility that they might be gorgeously
clothed and delicately fed. Silk stockings and
lamb chops! Both very expensive luxuries!
Well, they would learn their lesson young, which
was a blessing. Rump steaks and bare feet or
maybe cotton stockings and sandals would not
be so hard on them as on the poor little weakling
upstairs with her pretty eyes already reddened
at the first breath of disaster.</p>

<p>The library at the Carters&rsquo; home was a beautiful
room with not one jarring note. Low
bookshelves built into the walls were filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
books in rich bindings. Costly rugs covered the
floors. The walls were hung with signed etchings
and rare prints. Ordinarily George Wright
would have taken great pleasure in such a room,
but now he only looked upon it as just so much
more evidence of the selfishness of the females
of the Carter family and the unremitting toil of
the male.</p>

<p>He had not yet met any of the girls, but without
hesitation he came forward, his step singularly
light for one of his build. He spoke before
Helen, whose back was towards the door, had
even become aware of his presence. She gave
a little gasp, sprang from the low ottoman, and
faced the young physician, a spirit of antagonism
showing from the first in her flashing eyes and
sensitive nostrils. Helen had what Nan called
&ldquo;a speaking nose,&rdquo; and every emotion was shown
as clearly by her nose as by some persons&rsquo; eyes
and others&rsquo; mouths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to Miss Douglas Carter; but
since all of you are here, perhaps it might be just
as well for me to speak to all of you.&rdquo; The last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
part of his speech was made to Helen, whose attitude
of defiance was unmistakable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Douglas,&rdquo; said the elder girl, rising and
giving her hand graciously to the young man
whose blue eyes showed no gleam of humour now
and whose long upper lip was pulled down so far
and so grimly that his perfect teeth could not
do their part towards taking from the rugged
homeliness of his face. &ldquo;This is Helen, this Nan,
and this Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls shook hands with him, all but Helen.
She bowed, but as she bowed backwards, as it
were, that is, jerked her chin up rather than
down, it did not pass for courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; asked Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to talk to you girls like a
Dutch uncle and I might just as well get down to
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an engagement,&rdquo; said Helen icily, consulting
her tiny wrist watch, &ldquo;so I will be excused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is your engagement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever I choose to keep it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then I think you will choose to keep it
a little later. I have one, too, but am going to
spare a few minutes to talk about your father,
and I think it best for all of you to be present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas drew Helen down beside her. The
girl was trembling just like a young horse who
has felt the first spur. Robert Carter had always
said that Helen was the best child in the world
just so long as she had her own way. Fortunately
her own way was not a very wrong way
as a rule, but if there were a clash of wills, good-by
to the will that was not hers.</p>

<p>Who was this bushy-eyebrowed young Caliban
who came there ordering her about? She
would show him! But in the meantime Douglas
had an arm around her and Caliban was talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father is a very ill man and as his physician
I feel compelled to have a very serious
conversation with the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he die?&rdquo; whispered Lucy, all pertness
gone from her young face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, he will not die; but he may do
worse than die unless he can be allowed to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the rest that he should have been taking for
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could be worse than death?&rdquo; sobbed
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uselessness! Chronic nervous prostration!
His nerves have lost their elasticity and nothing
will cure him but a long rest, absolutely free from
care. Worries of all kinds, business, financial,
family, every kind, must be kept from him. As
I told your mother yesterday, a sea voyage would
be the best thing for him, a long, lazy trip. When
one gets on the water out of sight of land he
kind of loses his identity in the immensity of Creation.
That is what I want your father to do&mdash;lose
his identity. Your mother must go with him
to nurse him&mdash;he won&rsquo;t need much nursing, fortunately.
And now you girls have got to decide
among yourselves what is best to do. I know
your financial affairs are none of my business&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; from Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have to make your business my business
for the time being on account of my patient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Your father tells me he has absolutely no income
except what he gets from his profession. You
know that, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why no&mdash;that is&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Douglas.
&ldquo;Father never talked business with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um hum! I see! Just gave you ample allowances
and let you spend &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have never had allowances,&rdquo; spoke
Nan with her funny drawl. &ldquo;Just made bills instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright flashed an amused look at the girl
and for the first time they became aware of the
fact that he had a very handsome set of teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, for a year I see nothing but for
you to manage with very little and maybe not
that. You own this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; from the scornful Helen. &ldquo;We
can easily keep house here while our parents are
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Helen, keep house on what?&rdquo; asked
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, just keep house! Just go on living
here.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But when Father stops working, there is no
more money. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we will have to charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, charge on, and when your father gets
well, if he does get well, he will have an accumulation
of bills to meet which will be so good for
his health, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The young man looked the
scorn which he felt for Helen and addressed all
of his remarks after that to Douglas, who listened
attentively and gratefully. She well knew
it was no pleasant task for him to plunge into
their financial affairs, but he explained to her
that it was important for his patient to leave
town immediately if the change was to come in
time, and that left no opportunity for them to
consult the friends and relatives who would be
the natural ones to go to in this predicament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother wishes you to act in her stead
and your father is to give you power of attorney
so you can attend to any business for him. Can
I trust you to get them ready, without bustle
and confusion, by to-night? They can take
the train to New York leaving here at eight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
They can take a boat to the Bermudas and Panama
which sails to-morrow. I will go to New
York with them and see that they get off safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are very kind,&rdquo; murmured Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! I have business in New York,
anyhow, and I know the surgeon on that particular
boat, an old classmate of mine, and I want
to put him on to your father&rsquo;s case. But now we
come to the part you girls are to play. It is going
to be pretty hard on you, but you are not to
see your father before he goes. It would be exciting
for him and I want him to avoid all excitement.
Arrangements must be made and we must
get him off quietly, without bustle. If he sees
you, he will begin to question you about what you
are going to do while he is away, and as you don&rsquo;t
know yourselves, the old habit that is as much a
part of the whole family as fingers and toes will
assert itself, and the burden will fall on him, as
usual, and I can assure you I will not answer for
the consequences if one more ounce of worry is
put on that tired brain. I am going to bring a
notary public so he can give you, Miss Douglas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
power of attorney to transact any business for
him. I am loath to bring even this matter to
him, but that is necessary. As for what you are
to do with yourselves after your parents leave,
that is, of course, for you and your friends to
decide. My province as a nerve specialist ends
when I get my patient away, but begins again on
his return, and if he comes back and finds debts
waiting for him, I am pretty sure all the good of
the voyage will be done away with. I think his
mania is to keep out of debt. How he has managed
to do it I can&rsquo;t see, but he tells me the bills
are paid up to date. I am awfully sorry for all
of you, but I am much sorrier for that fine, unselfish
nature upstairs who has borne the heat of
the burden absolutely unassisted until he has
fallen under it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dr. Wright! Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; wailed
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brute!&rdquo; hissed Helen, but whether she meant
the young doctor or Helen Carter she wasn&rsquo;t herself
quite certain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he continued.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to criticise our mother!&rdquo; interrupted
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, I was merely going to
remark that your mother seems to be absolutely
necessary to the peace and happiness of your
father, otherwise I would insist upon his going
away alone. Often in these cases it is best for
the patient to get entirely away from all members
of his family, but I think she has a good effect
on him. I must go now and get the notary public
so you can enter into your office of vice regent.
I&rsquo;ll also make arrangements for the railroad trip
and long-distance my friend, the surgeon on the
steamer. I&rsquo;ll be back in a jiffy,&rdquo; and Dr. Wright
smiled very kindly at Douglas, whose young
countenance seemed to have aged years in the last
few minutes. &ldquo;I am trusting you to keep the
house quiet and get things in readiness without
once appealing to your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all any one can do,&rdquo; and George
Wright was grateful that there was one person in
the house he could look to for sense and calmness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
He noted with added confidence that
Douglas was very like her father in coloring and
that the general shape of their features was similar.
&ldquo;I hope they won&rsquo;t manage to break her in
two as they have him,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to help Douglas all we can,&rdquo;
drawled Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we are!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy. Helen said
nothing and did not acknowledge the bow that
included her as the young doctor made his exit
from the room.</p>

<p>Piercing shrieks came from the rear before
the front door was reached!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me! Give it to me! I ain&rsquo;t done
makin&rsquo; my puddin&rsquo; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be ruint if you don&rsquo;t
give it to me! Marmer! Marmer! Make &rsquo;em
give it to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A door noisily opened above and a rather sharp
call descended from the court of appeals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he want? Whatever it is, give it
to him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mis&rsquo; Carter, he done been in de silber
draw&rsquo; and &rsquo;stracted de tea strainer an&rsquo; dat new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fangled sparrowgrass flapper an&rsquo; done took de
bes&rsquo; fluted bum bum dish fer tow mold his mud
pies. I done tol&rsquo; him not tow meddle in de mud
no mo&rsquo; fo&rsquo; to-morrow as he is been washed an&rsquo;
dressed in his las&rsquo; clean suit till de wash comes
in. Jes&rsquo; look at him! An&rsquo; jes&rsquo; listen tow him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The irate old butler, Oscar, held by the hand
the screaming, squirming Bobby. One could
hardly help listening to him and it was equally
hard to help looking at him. His beauty was almost
unearthly: a slender little fellow of six,
with dark brown hair that curled in spite of the
barber&rsquo;s shears, the mouth of a cherub and eyes
that were the envy of all his sisters&mdash;great dark
eyes that when once you looked in them you were
forced to give up any anger you might feel for
him and just tumble head over heels in love with
him. That is what Dr. Wright did. He just
fell in love with him. Enraged for a moment by
the noise that he was trying so hard to make the
household feel must be kept from his patient, he
started angrily down the hall toward the angelic
culprit with a stern:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shhh! Your father is ill! You must stop
that racket!&rdquo; But one look in those eyes, and he
changed his tactics. Taking the naughty child
by his dirty little hand, he said: &ldquo;Say, Bob, how
would you like to come out with me in my car and
help me? I&rsquo;ve a lot of work to do and need some
one to blow my horn for me and stick out an arm
when we turn the corners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully! How much wages does you give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A milk shake if you are good, and another
kind if you are bad! Is it a go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; And once more quiet reigned in the
house. The upstairs door closed much more
softly than it had opened, and Oscar cheerfully
cleaned the silver that Bobby had left in such a
mess.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="f8">SILK STOCKINGS AND LAMB CHOPS.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well! What are we to do about it?&rdquo; queried
Nan as the front door closed on the doctor and
their precious torment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? Do what has come to us to do as quickly
as we can. I am going to see that mother&rsquo;s
clothes are packed and father&rsquo;s, too. It does
seem strange to be looking after his things. Oh,
girls, just think how we have always let him do it
himself! I can&rsquo;t remember even having darned
a sock for him in all my life,&rdquo; and Douglas gave
a little sob. &ldquo;This is no time for bawling,
though, I am going to let Dr. Wright see that I
am not just a doll baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright, indeed!&rdquo; sniffed Helen. &ldquo;Hateful,
rude thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Helen, I don&rsquo;t see why you need have it
in for him. I think he was just splendid! But
I can&rsquo;t wait to tell you what I think about him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
I must get busy.&rdquo; Douglas picked up her burden
with very much her father&rsquo;s look and hastened
off to do her young and inexperienced
best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for saying we can&rsquo;t see Father before he
goes, it is nothing but his arbitrariness that dictates
such nonsense,&rdquo; stormed Helen to the two
younger girls. &ldquo;He is just constituting himself
boss of the whole Carter family. I intend to see
Father and let him know how much I love him.
I&rsquo;d like to know how it would help any to have
poor dear Daddy go off without once seeing his
girls. Hasn&rsquo;t he always been seeing us and
haven&rsquo;t we always taken all our troubles to him?
How would we like it if he&rsquo;d let us go on a trip
and not come near to wish us <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon voyage</i>? You
silly youngsters can be hoodwinked by this bumptious
young doctor if you like, but I just bet you
he can&rsquo;t control me! I&rsquo;ve a great mind to go up
to Father&rsquo;s room right this minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you go, I&rsquo;m going, too,&rdquo; from Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither one of you is going,&rdquo; said Nan
quietly. &ldquo;Helen, you are acting this way just because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
you are ashamed of yourself. You ought
to be ashamed. I know I am so mortified I can
hardly hold up my head. We have been actually
criminal in our selfishness. I don&rsquo;t intend ever
as long as I live to get a new dress or a new hat
or a new anything, and when I do, I&rsquo;m going to
shop on the wrong side of Broad and get the very
cheapest and plainest I can find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! What does this ugly young man
know of our affairs and what money Daddy has
in the bank? I don&rsquo;t see that he is called on to
tell us when we shall and shan&rsquo;t make bills. He
is pretending that our own Father is crazy or
something. Won&rsquo;t answer for the consequences!
I reckon he won&rsquo;t. Why should he be right in
his diagnosis any more than Dr. Davis or Dr.
Drew or Dr. Slaughter or any of the rest of
them? Nervous prostration! Why, that is a
woman&rsquo;s disease. I bet Daddy will be good and
mad when he finds out what this young idiot is
giving him. How we will tease him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Dr. Wright is not an idiot and is not ugly
and is doing the very best he can do. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
think he liked giving it to us so? Of course
he didn&rsquo;t. I could see he just hated it. He
would have let us alone except he sees we
haven&rsquo;t a ray of sense among us, except maybe
Douglas. She showed almost human intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, Miss Nan. Maybe you
haven&rsquo;t any sense, but, thank you, I&rsquo;ve got just
as much as Douglas or that nasty old Dr. Wright
or anybody else, in fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, take in your sign then! You certainly
are behaving like a nut now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you? You think it shows sense to say
that man is not ugly? Why, I could have done
a better job on a face with a hatchet. He&rsquo;s got a
mug like Stony Man, that big mountain up at
Luray that looks like a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I thought,&rdquo; said Nan, &ldquo;and
that is what I liked about him. He looked kind
of like a rocky cliff and his eyes were like blue
flowers, growing kind of high up, out of reach,
but once he smiled at me and I knew they were
not out of reach, really. When he smiled sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
enough and showed his beautiful white teeth,
it made me think of the sun coming out suddenly
on the mountain cliff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Nan, if you can get some poetry out of
this extremely commonplace young man you are
a wonder. I am going down to see about my new
hat, so I&rsquo;ll bid you good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are getting another new hat, I intend
to have one, too!&rdquo; clamored Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; said Douglas, coming back into the
library. &ldquo;Of course you are going to countermand
the order for the hat that, after all, you do
not really need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Countermand it! Why, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard what Dr. Wright said, surely.
You must have taken in the seriousness of this
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seriousness much! I heard a very bumptious
young doctor holding forth on what is no
doubt his first case, laying down the law to us as
though he were kin to us about what we shall eat
and wear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen, you astonish me! I thought you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thought that you loved Father more than any of
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I do! None of you could love him as
much as I do. I love him so much that I do not
intend to stand for this nonsense about his going
off for months on a dirty old boat without ever
even being allowed to hug his girls. I bet he
won&rsquo;t let this creature boss him any more than I
will. Daddy said I could have another hat just
so I get a blue one. He doesn&rsquo;t think the one I
got is becoming, either,&rdquo; and Helen flounced off
up to her room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas, what do you think is the matter with
her? I have never seen Helen act like this before,&rdquo;
said Nan anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she is trying to shut her eyes to
Father&rsquo;s condition. Helen never could stand
anything being the matter with Father. You
know she always did hate and despise doctors,
too. Has ever since she was a little girl when
they took out her tonsils. She seemed to think
it was their fault. She will come to herself
soon,&rdquo; and Douglas wiped off another one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
tears that would keep coming no matter how hard
she tried to hold them back.</p>

<p>Indeed, Helen was a puzzle to her sisters, and
had they met her for the first time as you, my
readers have, no doubt they would have formed
the same opinion of her as you must have: a selfish,
heartless, headstrong girl. Now Helen was
in reality none of these terrible things, except
headstrong. Thoughtless she was and spoiled,
but generous to a fault, with a warm and loving
heart. Her love for her father was intense and
she simply would not see that he was ill. As
Douglas said, she disliked and mistrusted all doctors.
If the first and second and third were
wrong in their diagnoses, why not the fourth?
As for this absurd talk about money&mdash;what business
was it of this young stranger to put his finger
in their financial pie?</p>

<p>She shut her mind up tight and refused to understand
what Dr. Wright had endeavored to explain
to them, that there was no time to call in
consultation their old friends and relatives. Besides,
he wanted no excitement for the sick man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
no adieux from friends, no bustle or confusion.
He just wanted to spirit his patient away and get
him out of sight of land as fast as possible.</p>

<p>How could a perfect stranger understand her
dear father better than she, his own daughter,
did? Nervous prostration, indeed! Why, her
father had nerves of steel. You could fire a pistol
off right by his ear and he would not bat an
eyelash! She worked herself up even to thinking
that they were doing a foolish thing to allow
this beetle-browed young man to carry off their
mother and father, sending them to sea in a leaky
boat, no doubt, with some plot for their destruction
all hatched up with this ship&rsquo;s surgeon, this
one time classmate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, he was nice to Bobby,&rdquo; she said to
herself as she sat in her room, undecided whether
to go get the new hat in spite of Douglas or perhaps
twist the other one around so it would be
more becoming. &ldquo;That may be part of his deep
laid scheme&mdash;to get the confidence of the child
and maybe kidnap him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give in about the hat, but I&rsquo;ll not give in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
about seeing Daddy before he goes&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to
see him right this minute and find out for myself
just how sick he is, and if he, too, is hypnotized
into thinking this doctor man is any good. He
shan&rsquo;t go away if he doesn&rsquo;t want to. Poor little
Mumsy is too easy and confiding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Helen settled this matter to her own satisfaction,
convincing herself that it was really her
duty to go see her father and unearth the machinations
of this scheming Dr. Wright, who was so
disapproving of her. That really was where the
shoe pinched with poor Helen: his disapproval.
She was an extremely attractive girl and was accustomed
to admiration and approval. Her
youngest sister, Lucy, was about the only person
of her acquaintance who found any real fault
with her. Why, that young man seemed actually
to scorn her! What reason had he to come
pussy-footing into the library where she and her
sisters were holding an intimate conversation,
and all unannounced speak to them with his raucous
voice so that she nearly jumped out of her
skin? Come to think of it, though, his voice was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
not really raucous, but rather pleasant and deep.
Anyhow, he took her at a disadvantage from the
beginning and sneered at her and bossed her,
and she hated him and did not trust him one
inch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy, may I come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without knocking, Helen opened her father&rsquo;s
door and ran into his room. He was lying on the
sofa, covered with a heavy rug, although it was a
very warm day in May. His eyes were closed
and his countenance composed and for a moment
the girl&rsquo;s heart stopped beating&mdash;could he be
dead? He looked so worn and gaunt. Strange
she had not noticed it before. She had only
thought he was getting a little thin, but she hated
fat men, anyhow, and gloried in her father&rsquo;s athletic
leanness, as she put it. Most men of his
age, forty-three, had a way of getting wide in the
girth, but not her father. Forty-three! Why,
this man lying there looked sixty-three! His face
was so gray, his mouth so drawn.</p>

<p>Robert Carter opened his eyes and sighed
wearily.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; rather querulously. &ldquo;Oh,
Helen! I must have been asleep. I dreamed I
was out far away on the water. Just your
mother and I, far, far away! It was rather jolly.
Funny I was trying to add up about silk stockings
and I made such a ridiculous mistake. You
see there are five of you who wear silk stockings,
not counting Bobby and me. I wasn&rsquo;t counting
in socks. Five persons having two legs apiece
makes ten legs&mdash;silk stockings cost one dollar
apiece, no, a pair&mdash;fifty cents apiece&mdash;that makes
five dollars for ten legs. Everybody has to put
on a new pair every day, so that makes three hundred
and sixty-five pairs a year, three hundred
and sixty-six in leap year, seven hundred and
thirty stockings&mdash;that makes one thousand, eight
hundred and twenty-five dollars&mdash;thirty, in leap
year&mdash;just for stockings. Seems preposterous,
doesn&rsquo;t it? But here was my mistake, right here&mdash;people
don&rsquo;t have to put on a new pair every
day but just a clean pair, so I have to do my calculating
all over. You can help me, honey.
How many pairs of silk stockings does it take to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
run one of you? You just say one, and I can
compute the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daddy, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Helen burst
out crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t cry about it. It seems funny for
stockings to make any one cry. Do you know,
I&rsquo;ve been crying about them, too? It is so confusing
for people to have two legs and for leap
year to have one more day, so some years people
have to have more&mdash;maybe not have more, but
change them oftener. I cry out of one eye about
stockings, and the other sheds tears about French
chops. I feel very much worried about French
chops. It seems they sell them by the piece and
not by the pound as they do loin chops&mdash;ten cents
apiece, so the bills say. We usually get a dozen
and a half for a meal&mdash;eighteen&mdash;that&rsquo;s a dozen
and a half. Now there are seven of us and the
four servants, that makes eleven, not quite a
dozen. What I am worried about is that some
of you don&rsquo;t get two chops apiece. I am wondering
all the time which ones don&rsquo;t eat enough.
There is nothing at all on one little French chop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
although I&rsquo;m blessed if I could make one go down
me now. But, honey, promise me if your mother
and I do take this trip that this young man, whose
name has escaped me, is going to arrange for us,
that you will find out who it is among you who
eats only one chop and make &rsquo;em eat more. I am
afraid it is Nan and Bobby. They are more like
your mother, and of course fairies don&rsquo;t really
eat anything to speak of&mdash;but it must be of the
best&mdash;always of the best. She has never known
anything but luxury, and luxury she must have.
What difference does it make to me? I love to
work&mdash;but the days are too short. Take some
off of the night then&mdash;six hours in bed is enough
for any man. Edison says even that is too much.
What&rsquo;s that young man&rsquo;s name? Well, whatever
it is, I like him. He should have been an
architect&mdash;I bet his foundations would have gone
deep enough and the authorities would never have
condemned one of his walls as unsafe. That&rsquo;s
what they did to me, but it wasn&rsquo;t my fault&mdash;Shockoe
Creek was the trouble&mdash;creeping up like
a thief in the night and undermining my work.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>As Robert Carter rambled on in this weird,
disconnected way, the tears were streaming down
his face and Helen, crouched on the floor by his
side, was sobbing her heart out. Could this be
her Daddy? This broken, garrulous man with
the gray face and tears, womanish tears, flowing
shamelessly from his tired eyes? Dr. Wright
was right! Their father was a very ill man and
one more ounce of care would be too much for his
tired brain. Had she done him harm? Maybe
her coming in had upset his reason, but she had
not talked, only let him ramble on.</p>

<p>A car stopping at the door! The doctor and
Bobby returning with the notary public! What
must she do? Here she was in her father&rsquo;s
room, disobeying the stern commands of the physician
who could see with half his professional
eye that she had harmed his patient. She had
time to get out before the doctor could get upstairs&mdash;but
no! not sneak!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may be a murderess and am a selfish, headstrong,
bad, foolish, vain, extravagant wretch,
but I am not a sneak and I will stay right here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and take the ragging that I deserve&mdash;and no
doubt will get,&rdquo; remembering the lash that Dr.
Wright had not spared.</p>

<p>The doctor entered the room very quietly,
&ldquo;Pussy-footing still,&rdquo; said Helen to herself. He
gave her only a casual glance, seeming to feel no
surprise at her presence, but went immediately to
his patient, who smiled through his tears at this
young man in whom he was putting his faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asleep, doctor, and thought I was
out on the water. When Helen came in I awoke,
but I was very glad for her to come in so she
could promise me to look into a little matter of
French chops that was worrying me. She and I
have been having a little crying party about silk
stockings. They seem to make her cry, too.
Funny for me to cry. I have never cried in my
life that I can remember, even when I got a licking
as a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crying is not so bad for some one who never
has cried or had anything to cry for.&rdquo; Helen
had a feeling maybe he meant it for her but he
never looked at her. &ldquo;And now, Mr. Carter, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
have a notary public downstairs and I am going
to ask you to sign a paper giving to your daughter,
Douglas, power of attorney in your absence.
You get off to New York this evening and sail
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Dr. Whatsyourname, I can&rsquo;t leave until
I attend to tickets and things,&rdquo; feebly protested
the nervous man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tickets bought; passage on steamer to Bermuda
and Panama engaged; slow going steamer
where you can lie on deck and loaf and loaf!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tickets bought? I have never been anywhere
in my life where I have not had to attend to
everything myself. It sounds like my own funeral.
I reckon kind friends will step in then
and attend to the arrangements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s call this a wedding trip instead of
a funeral. I will be your best man and you and
your bride can spend your honeymoon on this
vessel. The best man sometimes does attend to
the tickets and in this case even decided where
the honeymoon should be spent. I chose a Southern
trip because I want you to be warm. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
few persons go to Bermuda in May, but I feel
sure you will be able to rest more if you don&rsquo;t
have to move around to keep warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s fine, and Annette is from the extreme
South and delights in warmth and sunlight.
I feel sure you have done right and am
just lying down like a baby and leaving everything
to you,&rdquo; and Robert Carter closed his eyes,
smiling feebly.</p>

<p>At a summons from the doctor, Douglas and
the notary public entered the room. Helen, who
had stayed to get the blowing up that she had expected
from Dr. Wright, not having got it, still
stayed just because she did not know how to
leave. No one noticed her or paid the least attention
to her except the notary, who bowed perfunctorily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the paper. You had better read it to
see if it is right. It gives your daughter full
power to act in your absence.&rdquo; Dr. Wright
spoke slowly and gently and his voice never
seemed to startle the sick man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Carter of age?&rdquo; asked the notary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
&ldquo;Otherwise she would have some trouble in any
legal matter that might arise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of age! No! I am only eighteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; said Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I, fool that I am,&rdquo; muttered the young
physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, let me make you her guardian, or
better still, give you power of attorney,&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, oh, I never bargained for that!&rdquo; The patient
feebly began to weep at this obstacle. You
never can tell what is going to upset a nervous
prostrate. &ldquo;Well, all right. I can do it if it is
up to me,&rdquo; the doctor muttered. &ldquo;Put my name
in where we have Miss Carter&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said to the
notary. &ldquo;George Wright is my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to know your name; that is one of
the things that has been worrying me,&rdquo; said the
patient, as he signed his name and the notary affixed
his seal after the oaths were duly taken.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="f8">GONE!</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I am waiting, Dr. Wright,&rdquo; said Helen, after
the notary public had taken his departure and
Douglas had gone to put finishing touches to the
very rapid packing of steamer trunks, Mrs.
Carter helping in her pathetically inefficient way.
Helen stood at the top of the stairs to intercept
the doctor as he left the patient&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waiting for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you to tell me you were astonished to find
me in my father&rsquo;s room when you had given express
orders that none of us were to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was not astonished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you expected to find me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know whether I should find you, but
I knew very well you would go there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you thought I would sneak in and sneak
out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not call it sneaking but I was pretty sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
you had no confidence in me and would do your
own sweet will. I hope you are satisfied now
that it was best not to excite your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did not excite him. He just talked in
that terrible way himself. You are cruel to say
I made him worse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did not say so. Certainly, however,
you made him no better. He said himself he
waked when you came in and you did not deny
it. Of course, sleep is always &lsquo;kind Nature&rsquo;s
sweet restorer.&rsquo; If you will let me pass, I will
now go to see Miss Douglas about ordering your
car for the train this evening. We have only
about an hour&rsquo;s time and there is still a great deal
to do. There is the expressman now for the
trunks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t even trust me to order the chauffeur to
have the car at the door,&rdquo; cried Helen bitterly to
herself as the doctor went past her. &ldquo;I am of
no use to any one in the whole world and I wish
I were dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The look of agony in the girl&rsquo;s face made an
impression on the young man in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
strong resentment he felt toward her. He was
somewhat like Helen in that he was not accustomed
to disapproval, and being flouted by this
schoolgirl was not a pleasant morsel to swallow.
He felt sure of his diagnosis of Mr. Carter&rsquo;s case,
for, having served for several years as head assistant
in a large sanitarium in New York, he
was well acquainted with the symptoms of nervous
prostration. Of course, his sending the patient
on a sea voyage instead of placing him in a
sanitarium was somewhat of a risk, but he felt
it was the best thing to do, reading the man&rsquo;s
character as he had.</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s scorn and doubt of him and her seeming
selfishness had certainly done little to recommend
her in his eyes, but gentleness and sympathy
were the strongest points in George Wright&rsquo;s
make-up, and as he went by the girl he could read
in her face agony, extreme agony and desperation.
He went up the steps again, two at a time,
and said gently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Helen, would you be so kind as to see
about the car for me? Order it for 7.45. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
going to put them on at the downtown station and
get them all installed in the drawing-room with
the door shut so they need not see all the Richmond
people who are sure to be taking this night
train to New York and getting on at Elba, the
uptown stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; thought the young man, &ldquo;that girl
is some looker! If she had the sense of her sister
Douglas, I believe she would be pretty nice,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen&rsquo;s whole countenance had changed.
From the proud, scornful girl, she had turned
again into her own self, the Helen her sisters
knew and loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might see that Bobby is kept kind of
quiet, too. Tell him I will take him out with me
again soon and let him blow my horn and poke
out his arm when we turn the corners, if he will
be quiet for an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Helen meekly, wondering at
her own docility in so calmly being bossed by this
person whom she still meant to despise. She interviewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the chauffeur, ordering the car at the proposed
time, and then captured Bobby, who was
making his way to his father&rsquo;s room. She inveigled
him into the back yard where she kept him
in a state of bliss, having her supper out there
with him and playing tea party to his heart&rsquo;s content,
even pretending to eat his wonderful mud
&ldquo;pies an&rsquo; puddin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was almost time for the dread departure and
still she kept watch over Bobby. The mother
came out in the back yard to kiss her children
good-by. Poor little mother! The meadow
brook has surely come on rocky places now.
What effect is it to have? Perhaps the channel
will be broadened and deepened when the shoals
are past. Who knows?</p>

<p>Gone, at last! No one even to wave farewell,
so implicitly did the Carter household obey the
stern mandates of the doctor. Even the negro
servants kept in the background while their beloved
master and mistress were borne away by
the smoothly rolling car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems mos&rsquo; lak a funeral,&rdquo; sobbed Oscar, &ldquo;lak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a funeral in yellow feber times down in Mobile,
whar I libed onct. Nobody went to them funerals
fer fear er ketching sompen from de corpse.
Saddes&rsquo; funerals ebber I seed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were sure those funerals could not
have been any sadder than this going away of
their parents. Once more they gathered in the
library, as forlorn a family as one could find in
the whole world, they were sure. Their eyes
were red and their noses redder. Douglas had
had the brunt of the labor in getting the packing
done and had held out wonderfully until it was all
over, and now she had fallen in a little heap on
the sofa and was sobbing her soul out.</p>

<p>Nan was doing her best to comfort her while
Lucy was bawling like a baby on Helen&rsquo;s shoulder,
truce between the two declared for the time
being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel just like the British would if the Rock
of Gibraltar had turned into brown sugar and
melted into the sea,&rdquo; declared Helen, when the
storm had blown itself out and a calmness of despair
had settled down on all of them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; agreed Nan. &ldquo;Father has
always been just like Gibraltar to us. His picture
would have done just as well for the Prudential
Life Insurance ad as Gibraltar did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could just have heard him talk as he
did to me. Oh, girls, I feel as though I had killed
him!&rdquo; and Helen gave a dry sob that made Lucy
put an arm around her. &ldquo;I have sworn a solemn
swear to myself: I am not going to wear a single
silk stocking nor yet a pair of them until Father
comes home, and not then unless he is well. I
have some old cotton ones that I got for the
Camp-Fire Girls&rsquo; hike, the only ones I ever had
since I can remember, and I am going to wear
those until I can get some more. I hate &rsquo;em, too!
They make my toes feel like old rusty potatoes in
a bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This made the girls laugh. A laugh made
them feel better. Maybe behind the clouds the
sun was, after all, still shining and they would
not have to wear rubbers and raincoats forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remind me of the old man we saw up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Wytheville who had such very long whiskers,
having sworn never to cut them off or trim them
until the Democrats elected a President,&rdquo; drawled
Nan. &ldquo;Those whiskers did some growing between
Cleveland&rsquo;s and Wilson&rsquo;s Administrations.
You remember when Wilson was elected and he
shaved them off, his wife made a big sofa cushion
out of them; and the old man had become so used
to the great weight on his chin, that now he
was freed from it, his chin just naturally flew up
in the air and made him look like his check rein
was too tight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; declared Lucy; &ldquo;and his
wife said she was going to strap the cushion back
on where his whiskers used to be if he didn&rsquo;t stop
holding his head so haughty.&rdquo; Another laugh
and the sun came out in their hearts.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright had assured them that their father
would be well. He had had many patients who
had been in much worse condition who were now
perfectly well. Mr. Carter&rsquo;s case had been taken
hold of in time and the doctor was trusting to his
splendid constitution and the quiet of the ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to work wonders in him. In the meantime, it
was necessary for the girls to begin to think
about what they were to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we had better not try to come to any
conclusion to-night,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;we are all
of us so worn out, at least I am. We will sleep
on it and then to-morrow get together and all try
to bring some plan and idea. There was almost
no money left in the bank after the tickets for
the voyage were bought and money put in Mother&rsquo;s
bag for incidentals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little Muddy, just think of her having
to be the purse bearer! I don&rsquo;t believe she
knows fifty cents from a quarter,&rdquo; sighed
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mother will have to go to school just
like the rest of us. I fancy we only know the
difference in size and not much about the value
of either. Dr. Wright wrote a check for the
amount in bank, showing from Father&rsquo;s check
book, and after he had paid for the tickets, he left
the rest for me to put to my account. I am
awfully mortified, but I don&rsquo;t know how to deposit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
money&mdash;and as for writing a check&mdash;I&rsquo;d
sooner write a thesis on French history. I know
I could do it better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas smothered a little sigh. This was no
time to think of self or to repine about her private
ambitions, but somehow the thought would
creep in that this meant good-by to college for
her. She had planned to take examinations for
Bryn Mawr early in June and was confident of
passing. She had her father&rsquo;s ability to stick to
a thing until it was accomplished, and no matter
how distasteful a subject was to her, she mastered
it. This was her graduating year at
school. Now all joy of the approaching commencement
was gone. She was sorry that her
dress was already bought, and in looking over
the check book, she had found it was paid for,
too. Forty dollars for one dress and that of material
that had at the best but little wearing quality!
Beautiful, of course, but when a family had
been spending money as freely as this family had
always done, what business had one of them with
a forty dollar white dress with no wear to it when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the balance in the bank showed only eighty-three
dollars and fifty-nine cents?</p>

<p>A sharp ringing of the front door bell interrupted
Douglas&rsquo;s musings and made all of
the sisters conscious of their red eyes and
noses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who under Heaven? It is nine o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Lizzie Somerville, of course. She
always rings like the house was on fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Miss Elizabeth Somerville, a second
cousin of their father. She came into the library
in rather unseemly haste for one of her usual
dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your father?&rdquo; she demanded, without
the ceremony of greeting the girls. &ldquo;I must
see him immediately. Your mother, too, of
course, if she wants to come down, but I must see
your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone where? When will he return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about two months,&rdquo; said Helen coolly.
Helen was especially gifted in tackling Cousin
Lizzie, who was of an overbearing nature that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
needed handling. &ldquo;He and Mother have gone to
Bermuda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bermuda in the summer! Nonsense! Tell
me when I can see him, as it is of the greatest importance.
I should think you could see that I am
in trouble and not stand there teasing me,&rdquo; and
since it was to be a day of tears, Cousin Lizzie
burst out crying, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cousin Lizzie, I am so sorry! I did not
mean to tease. I am not teasing. Father is ill,
you must have noticed how knocked up he has
been looking lately, and the doctor has taken him
with Mother to New York. They have just
gone, and they are to sail on a slow steamer to
Bermuda and Panama in the morning. Please let
us help you if we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You help! A lot of silly girls! It is about
my nephew Lewis!&rdquo; and the poor lady wept anew.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="f8">LEWIS SOMERVILLE.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Lewis! What on earth can be the matter with
him?&rdquo; chorused the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter enough! He has been shipped!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shipped? Oh, Cousin Lizzie, you can&rsquo;t mean
it!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas, drying her eyes as she
began to realize that she was not the only miserable
person in the world whose ambitions had
gone awry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure if he has been fired, it is from no
fault of his own,&rdquo; declared Nan, who was a loyal
soul and always insisted that her friends and relatives
were in the right until absolute proof to the
contrary was established.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whether it was his fault or not, I am
not prepared to say. &lsquo;Where there is so much
smoke there must be some fire.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls had to smile at this, as there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
never a time when Cousin Lizzie did not have a
proverb ready to suit the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the fire might not have been of his
kindling,&rdquo; insisted Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please tell us what the trouble is, Cousin Lizzie,
if you don&rsquo;t mind talking about it,&rdquo; begged
Douglas. &ldquo;Has Lewis really left West Point for
good? I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble is: &lsquo;Evil communications corrupt
good manners.&rsquo; If Lewis had not been with the
companions that he has chosen, he would not
have gotten into this trouble. Surely Solomon
was wise indeed when he said: &lsquo;Whoso keepeth
the law is a wise son, but he that is a companion
of riotous men shameth his father.&rsquo; I am glad
my poor brother is dead and not here to witness
his son&rsquo;s disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Lizzie, I do not believe that Lewis has
done anything disgraceful,&rdquo; insisted Nan, speaking
almost quickly for once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a disgrace in my mind for the son
and grandson of Confederate soldiers to be dismissed
from a Yankee institution, whether he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was in fault or not. &lsquo;As a bird that wandereth
from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from
his place.&rsquo; A Somerville&rsquo;s place is in the South
and it was always against my wishes that Lewis
went to West Point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please tell us what the trouble is, what Lewis
did or didn&rsquo;t do at West Point,&rdquo; said Helen in the
determined voice that usually made Cousin Lizzie
stop her proverbs long enough to give the information
required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hazing a plebe,&rsquo; is what he said. What a
plebe is or what hazing is I do not know, but
whatever it is, Lewis says he was not mixed up
in it, but he, with eight other second classmen,
were let out. The words are his, not mine. All I
know is that he was discharged and is at my
house now in a state of dejection bordering on
insanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor boy! We are so sorry for him. What
is he going to do now?&rdquo; asked Douglas.</p>

<p>Here was another disappointment for Douglas.
Her cousin, Lewis Somerville, was one of the
dearest friends she had in the world. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
two years her senior and had made it his business
since they were tiny tots to protect her and look
after her on all occasions. They had had a plan
for the following year that now, of course, had
fallen through. She was to have come to West
Point from Bryn Mawr to the finals. He would
then have been a third classman and able to make
her have a rip-roaring time, as he had expressed
it.</p>

<p>Lewis in a state of dejection bordering on insanity!
That was unbelievable. If there ever
was a gayer, happier person than Lewis, she had
never seen him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? Goodness knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say,&rdquo; put in Nan, &ldquo;is that
Uncle Sam is a fool not to know that Lewis is a
born soldier, and if he wants to prepare himself
to defend his country, he should be allowed to
do so. Oh, I don&rsquo;t care what he has done&mdash;I just
know he hasn&rsquo;t done it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to &rsquo;phone him this minute and tell
him to come around here!&rdquo; and Helen jumped up
from her seat, thereby waking Lucy, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
dropped asleep on her shoulder, worn out with
the stress of emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are, so am I&mdash;whatever it is,&rdquo; declared
Lucy, rubbing her eyes, as determined as ever to
keep up with Helen or die in the attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! is this you, Lewis?&rdquo; as the connection
was quickly made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; in a tired, dreary voice. &ldquo;What is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is me, Lewis, Helen Carter! We are all
sitting up here dressed in our best waiting for
you to come to see us. Douglas says if you don&rsquo;t
hurry she, for one, is going to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; in a little brisker tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Lewis, we are in an awful lot of trouble.
You know Father is ill and has had to go away
and we don&rsquo;t know what is to become of us. We
need your advice terribly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be &rsquo;round in a jiffy,&rdquo; and so he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was very tactful of you, Helen,&rdquo; said
Cousin Lizzie lugubriously. &ldquo;You know &lsquo;Misery
loves company.&rsquo;&rdquo; But a peal from the front
door bell interrupted further quotations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Lewis Somerville came tearing into the house in
answer to Helen&rsquo;s S.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;S.</p>

<p>He did look as dejected as one of his make-up
could. It is hard to be dejected very long when
one is just twenty, in perfect health, with naturally
high spirits and the strength to remove
mountains tingling in the veins. A jury of
women could not have shipped the young would-be
soldier, and it must have taken very hard-hearted
men, very determined on maintaining discipline,
deliberately to have cut this young fellow&rsquo;s
career in two. Our army must be full of
very fine young men if they can so lightly give up
such a specimen as this Lewis Somerville. Imagine
a young giant of noble proportions, as erect
as an ash sapling that has had all the needed room
in which to grow, a head like Antinous and frank
blue eyes that could no more have harbored a lie
than that well-cut, honest mouth could have
spoken one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it and just to let me know that you
don&rsquo;t believe I did, you have got to kiss me all
around.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Lewis! Helen and I are too old to
kiss you even if you are a cousin,&rdquo; and Douglas
got behind Cousin Lizzie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Douglas, &lsquo;The heart of the prudent
getteth knowledge.&rsquo; Lewis is not such very
close kin, besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Lizzie, I did not expect you to
desert me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not good to eat much honey, so for men
to search their own glory is not glory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Nan and Lucy will kiss me, anyhow.
They believe I did not do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are sure you are telling the truth,&rdquo; said
Douglas gravely. &ldquo;We do not know yet what
they say you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say I helped a lot of fellows tie a plebe
to a tree and drop ice down his back, making out
it was red hot pennies, until the fellow fainted
from his fancied injuries. I never did it, but if
I had, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a patching on the
things the second classmen did to me last year
when I was a plebe, and wild horses would not
have dragged a complaint from me. It was done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
by some men who are my chums, but I declare I
was not with the crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know it! we know it!&rdquo; from all the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to talk about myself&mdash;I am
so anxious to hear what is the matter with Cousin
Robert. Let&rsquo;s let up on me and talk about your
trouble, and if I can help, please command me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father is very ill,&rdquo; said Douglas soberly.
&ldquo;He has been working too hard for a long time
and now his nerves have just given way and he
has had to stop and go on a trip. Dr. Wright
assures us that he has stopped in time and a sea
trip and a year&rsquo;s rest will completely restore him.
It has come on us so suddenly that we have not
had time to catch our breath even.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is this Dr. Wright?&rdquo; asked Cousin
Lizzie. &ldquo;I thought Dr. Davis was your family
physician. Some Yankee, I&rsquo;ll be bound, with all
kinds of new notions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is from Washington recently, but I
believe he came originally from New York
State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you let a perfect stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
pick up your parents and send them off on a journey
without consulting a soul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was important to avoid all confusion
and discussion. Dr. Wright has been lovely
about it all. He even got a notary public so I
could be given power of attorney to attend to any
business that might come up. It so happened,
though, that my being under age was a drawback
and Father gave him power of attorney
instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas Carter! Do you mean to say that a
strange young Yankee doctor that has only been
living in Richmond a little while has the full
power to sell your father out and do anything he
chooses with his estate? Preposterous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t any estate,&rdquo; objected Douglas,
and Helen could not help a little gleam of satisfaction
creeping into her eyes. She was not the
only person who felt that Dr. Wright had been,
to say the least, presumptuous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No estate! Why I thought Robert Carter
was very well off. What has he done with his
money, please?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have just lived on it. We didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
sadly from Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of such extravagance. &lsquo;A fool
and his money are soon parted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have got just exactly eighty-three dollars
and fifty-nine cents in the bank. Father owns
this house and a side of a mountain in Albemarle,
and that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy, child! I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have got to live somehow, and I believe
we all feel that it would be very bad for Father
to come back and find debts to be paid off. He
has such a horror of debt that he has always paid
the bills each month. What do you think we
could do&mdash;something to make money, I mean?
Father was in such a nervous state we could not
consult him, and Mother, poor little Mother, of
course she does not understand business at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! I should say not! And what do
you chits of girls know about it, either? Are you
meaning to stay alone, all un-chaperoned, until
this Yankee doctor thinks it is time to let your
parents return? Just as like as not there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the matter with your father but a touch of
malaria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had not thought of a chaperone, as we
have been so miserable about Father we could not
think of ourselves. If we are going to make a
living, we won&rsquo;t need chaperones, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a living, indeed! You are to stay right
here in your home and I will come stay with you,
and you can curtail your expenses somewhat by
dismissing one servant and giving up your car.
Robert Carter is not the kind of man who would
want his eighteen-year-old daughter and others
even younger to go out into the world to make a
living. He would rather die than have such a
thing happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we are not going to have him die,&rdquo; broke
in Helen. &ldquo;I thought just as you do, Cousin Lizzie,
until I saw him this afternoon and realized
how worried he has been. We are going to do
something and there are to be no debts awaiting
him, either. What do you think of boarders?
Do you think we could get any?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who on earth would board with us, here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Richmond? Everybody knows what a trifling
lot we are. If we have boarders, it will have to
be on the side of the mountain in Albemarle,&rdquo;
said Nan, and as usual every one stopped to hear
what she had to say. &ldquo;Besides, a boarding house
in summer shuts up shop in cities. Country
board is the thing. Let&rsquo;s rent our house furnished
for a year and go to the mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are nothing but trees and rocks on
the side of the mountain in Albemarle,&rdquo; objected
Douglas; &ldquo;not a piece of a house except a log
cabin near the top built by the sick Englishman
who used to live there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No room for boarders in that, I know, as
Father pointed it out to me once from the train
when we were on our way to Wytheville. It had
one room and maybe two. It must command a
wonderful view. You could see it for miles and
miles and when you get up there, there is no telling
what you can see. It would make a great
camp&mdash;Girls! Girls! Cousin Lizzie! Lewis! All
of you! I&rsquo;ve got a scheme! It just came to me!&rdquo;
and Helen jumped up and ran around and hugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
everybody, even the cousin she and Douglas had
grown too big to kiss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, cough it up! We are just as anxious as
can be to share your idea, or is it so big it got
stuck on the way,&rdquo; laughed Lewis, accepting
the caress as it was meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a boarding camp, with Cousin Lizzie
to chaperone us! I know just lots of girls
who would simply die to go, and Albemarle is
close enough for week-enders to pour in on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah! And I bid to be man-of-all
work! I know rafts of fellows who would
want to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and let&rsquo;s call it Week End Camp,&rdquo; said
Nan. &ldquo;Week to be spelled W-E-A-K. What
do you think of the plan, Cousin Lizzie? If you
are to be chaperone, it seems to me you should
be consulted the first thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, child. Things are moving too
rapidly for me. We must go a little more
slowly,&rdquo; and truly the old lady did look dazed indeed.
&ldquo;&lsquo;More haste, less speed,&rsquo; is a very good
adage.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Cousin Lizzie, it does sound crazy in a
way, but do you know, I believe we could really
do it and do it very well,&rdquo; said Douglas. &ldquo;I consider
Helen a genius to have thought of such a
thing. I don&rsquo;t think the outlay need be very
great, and surely the living would be cheap when
once we get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, at my age I could not begin to
eat out of doors. I have not done such a thing
since I can remember but once, and then I went
with the United Daughters of the Confederacy
on a picnic. The undertaker went ahead with
chairs and tables so everything was done in decency
and order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Funeral baked meats!&rdquo; made them all
laugh, even Cousin Lizzie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to have a short khaki suit with
leggins coming way up,&rdquo; declared Helen, who
could not contemplate anything without seeing
herself dressed to suit the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; sleepily from Lucy, who was trying
to keep awake long enough to find out what it all
meant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Lizzie, I wish you would consent. It
all depends on you. You could eat in the cabin
and sleep in the cabin and not camp out at all.
I could go up right away and build the camp. I&rsquo;d
just love to have something to do. Bill Tinsley,
from Charlottesville, got shipped with me and
I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;d join me. You&rsquo;d like Bill,
he&rsquo;s so quaint. We are both of us great carpenters
and could make a peach of a job of it. Do,
please, Aunt Lizzie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could this be the young man who, only ten
minutes ago, she had described as being in a state
of dejection bordering on insanity? This enthusiastic
boy with his eyes dancing in joyful anticipation
of manual labor to be plunged into? If
she consented to go to the mountains, thereby no
doubt making herself very uncomfortable, she
might save her beloved nephew from doing the
thing that she was dreading more than all others,
dreading it so much that she had been afraid
to give voice to it: going to France to fight with
the Allies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Lewis, if this plan means that you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
find occupation and happiness, I will consent. I
can&rsquo;t bear to think of your being idle. &lsquo;Satan
finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cousin Lizzie, I think you are just splendid!&rdquo;
exclaimed Helen.</p>

<p>And, indeed, Miss Elizabeth Somerville was
splendid in her way. She was offering herself
on the altar of aunthood. It was a real sacrifice
for her to consent to this wild plan of going to
the mountains. She hated snakes, and while she
did not confess that she hated Nature, she certainly
had no love for her. Her summer outings
had meant, heretofore, comfortable hotels at the
springs or seashore, where bridge was the rule
and Nature the exception. The promise of being
allowed to sleep in the cabin and even eat in it was
not any great inducement. A log cabin, built
and lived in and finally, no doubt, died in, by a
sick Englishman was not very pleasant to contemplate.
Miss Lizzie was very old-fashioned in
all her ideas with the exception of germs, and she
was very up-to-date as to them. No modern scientist
knew more about them or believed in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
more implicitly. Oh, well! She could take along
plenty of C.&nbsp;N. and sulphur candles and crude
carbolic. That would kill the germs. She would
find out the latest cure for snake bite, and with
a pack of cards for solitaire perhaps she could
drag out an existence until Robert Carter and
Annette got home from this mad trip. All she
hoped was that nobody would wake her up to see
the sun rise and that she would not be called on
to admire the moon every time there was a moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we can get the daily paper,&rdquo; she
moaned feebly. &ldquo;I hate to go too far from the
daily paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get it if I have to build a flying machine
and fly to Richmond for it,&rdquo; declared Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The place is not half a mile from the post
office,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;At least, that is the way it
looks from the train. When can we get started?
I don&rsquo;t think it is worth while to go back to school
any more. We can all of us just stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, of course we can&rsquo;t! Douglas is
going to graduate, and Lucy and I have our exams
next week. What would Father say at our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
giving up right now? You can quiturate all
you&rsquo;ve a mind to, but I intend to go on and graduate
and go to college like Douglas,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I&rsquo;ll have to give up college, but I
am going to take my Bryn Mawr examinations
just the same because I want Father to know I
can stand them.&rdquo; Douglas hoped sincerely that
the tear she felt gathering would evaporate before
it dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give up college! Why, Douglas Carter, I
don&rsquo;t see what you mean. You have been full
of it all winter,&rdquo; exclaimed Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Helen, you know perfectly well there is
no more money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I keep on forgetting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing that I have forgotten, too,
and I feel awfully bad about it after all his kindness,&rdquo;
said Douglas. &ldquo;That is, we must make no
decided plans until we consult Dr. Wright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consult Dr. Wright, indeed! I&rsquo;d like to
know what&rsquo;s it to him,&rdquo; said Helen wrathfully.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we even go on a summer trip without asking
his permission?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think inasmuch as he has power of
attorney and we can&rsquo;t do anything without money
that we shall have to consult him. He&rsquo;ll be home
to-morrow night and we can ask him immediately.
I am pretty sure he will think it a good
thing, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but for goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t tell him
it was my idea originally, as he hates me as much
as I hate him, and if <em>he</em> had thought of it, I just
know I&rsquo;d never have consented or thought it a
good plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know one thing,&rdquo; said Miss Somerville,
&ldquo;I am dead tired and this child here is
asleep. We had better go to bed and get all the
rest we can if we are going to camp out for the
summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How different the night was from what the
Carters had looked forward to! Sleepless misery
was what they had been sure would be their lot,
and instead, they went to their beds with their
heads full of their week-end boarding camp.
Father was to get well on his voyage and come
back to join them in Albemarle. Instead of finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
debts piled on debts, their camp was to pay
and he was to find his girls actually making a
living.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cotton stockings will be the appropriate
things to wear at camp,&rdquo; was the last thought
Helen had. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I could spend the
summer in town after the oath I have taken. I
couldn&rsquo;t show my face, or rather my feet, on the
street.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="f8">THE RECONSTRUCTION.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Helen, I actually slept all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I. If any one had told me I could
sleep a wink, I would have been furious. I wish
we could hear from Father. You saw Cousin
Lizzie felt just exactly as I did about that Dr.
Wright. He may be all right and he may be all
wrong. If he is all wrong, couldn&rsquo;t he make us
dance, though? He could sell us out, lock, stock
and barrel, pocket the proceeds and skidoo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, how can you even give such a horrid
idea a moment&rsquo;s lodgement in your mind?
Dr. Wright is as good as he looks, I am sure.
He certainly looks kind and honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he ought to be honest he is so ugly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were still in bed, which they had
shared ever since they had been promoted from
cradles. It was Saturday morning and the day
before had been the one of trial.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Father likes him a lot and trusts him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;s, I know&mdash;but then, you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see he is a very fine young man who
thought, and quite rightly, that we had been
blindly selfish and heartless to let Father work so
hard; and he let us know what he thought of us
and it got your goat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the way you are going to express yourself
in your B.&nbsp;M. exams? Because if it is, you
will win a scholarship surely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only could!... Come in!&rdquo; in answer to
a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telegraph fer you, Miss Douglas. I hope
an&rsquo; trus&rsquo; &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no bad news &rsquo;bout yo&rsquo; maw and
paw,&rdquo; said the housemaid, bringing in a dreaded
yellow envelope. &ldquo;Uncle Oscar, he dreamed
&rsquo;bout aigs las&rsquo; night an&rsquo; they was whole an&rsquo; entire,
an&rsquo; all de dream books say dat it is a sho&rsquo;
sign an&rsquo; symbol er trouble. De trouble is in de
shell an&rsquo; time alone will hatch it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is good news, Susan,&rdquo; laughed
Douglas as she quickly scanned the message:
&ldquo;&lsquo;Your father and mother slept well and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
now enjoying breakfast at Pennsylvania Station.
Will see you this evening. George
Wright.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Glory be! It can&rsquo;t be Mr. Carter what
the bad luck is layin&rsquo; fer. I &rsquo;low it is dat lo&rsquo; down
nigger Jim, Uncle Oscar&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s step-son, what
got stuck in de lonesome ribs by a frien&rsquo; at
meetin&rsquo; las&rsquo; Sunday with one er these here unsafety
razors,&rdquo; and Susan took herself off to give
out in the kitchen that no doubt Jim was going
to die, since Mr. Carter was improving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Helen, don&rsquo;t you think Dr. Wright is
very thoughtful? You just said you wished we
could hear from Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does seem to think of lots of things. I
couldn&rsquo;t help admiring him for the way he got
the drawing room for them and put them on the
train at the downtown station to keep them from
having to see so many people. That night train
is always full of people we know and they all of
them get on at Elba. I bet you he got his telegram
in ten words, though. I know he is economical
and would die rather than spill over. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
me see it. Humph! Nineteen words. I wonder
he didn&rsquo;t send it collect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen! How can you be so hard on the
poor young man? I believe you are just pretending
to hate him so. I am glad it is Saturday and
no school. I think we had better go see real estate
agents the first thing this morning and try
to rent our house furnished for the summer. I
am pretty sure Dr. Wright would approve of
that. And also see about selling the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selling the car! Why, Douglas, how on earth
will we do without it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we must sell it. Helen Carter, I
actually believe you think that if you give up
wearing silk stockings for a year we can live
on your resolution. Do you realize that the cash
we have in bank would just about pay the chauffeur
and keep us in gasoline for a month?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am such a dunce! I am afraid my being
poor has a kind of musical comedy effect in
my mind so far. What are you going to do with
me, Douglas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, honey, but you must not get angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with me when I call you down about money. I
feel so responsible somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angry with you! Why, I think you are just
splendid, and I am going to be so careful I just
know you will never have to call me down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas smiled, knowing very well that
Helen and economy were not meant to dwell together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one thing I am going to make all
of you promise, that is NOT TO CHARGE,&rdquo;
with great emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course not after we get started, but
how are we to get our outfits for the mountains?
Our khaki skirts and leggins and things that are
appropriate? And then the cotton stockings that
I have sworn to wear until Father is well! I
have to have a new set of them. Ugh! how I
hate &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Helen, we have our Camp-Fire outfits
that are thoroughly suitable for what we are going
to do. There are loads of middy blouses in
the house, so I am sure we need buy no more of
them. As for stockings&mdash;it seems to me you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
better wear out what stockings you have, even if
they are silk, before you buy any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never! You don&rsquo;t seem to understand the
significance of my oath. When a pilgrim of old
swore to put on sackcloth and travel to some distant
shrine, he didn&rsquo;t say he would not go to the
expense of sackcloth since he had plenty of velvet
suits on hand, did he now? No! He went and
bought some sackcloth if he didn&rsquo;t happen to have
any in the house and gave his velvet suits to the
poor or had his hand-maidens pack them up in
frankincense and myrrh or something until he
got back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! All right! But please don&rsquo;t give
away anything to the poor. If Cousin Lizzie
should hear of your doing such a thing she would
certainly say: &lsquo;Charity begins at home.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give them away if you think I
shouldn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;d like to put temptation out of my
reach. I hope we can get off to the mountains
real soon as I am sure I have no desire to flaunt
my penance in the face of the Richmond public.
Don&rsquo;t you think, Douglas, that I might have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fifty-nine cents that is in the bank so things will
balance better, and with fifty-nine cents I can get
three pair of sixteen-and-two-third-cent stockings?
I&rsquo;ll bring back the nine cents change.&rdquo;
Helen was quite solemn in her request, but Douglas
was forced to laugh at her lugubrious countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, if you really feel so strongly about
the cotton stockings. Haven&rsquo;t you any money
at all in your purse? I have a little, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never thought of that! Sure I have!&rdquo;
and Helen sprang out of bed, where they were
still lolling while the above conversation was going
on, and hunted wildly in a very much mussed
drawer for her silver mesh bag. &ldquo;Hurrah!
Three paper dollars and a pile of chicken feed silver!
I can get cotton stockings for a centipede
with that much money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a very pretty room that Douglas and
Helen Carter shared. Robert Carter had
brought to bear all the experience he had gained
in building other persons&rsquo; houses to make his own
house perfect. It was not a very large house but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
every detail had been thought out so not one brick
was amiss. Convenience and Beauty were not
sacrificed to one another but went hand in hand.
The girls loved their room with its dainty pink
paper and egg-shell paint. They had not been in
the house long enough for the novelty to wear
off, as it was only about a year old. As Douglas
lay in her luxurious bed while Helen, being up in
search of money, took first bath, she thought of
the bitterness of having strangers occupy their
room. How often she had lain in that soft, comfortable
nest and fancied that it must be like the
heart of a pink rose. And the charming private
bath-room must be given up, too.</p>

<p>She could hear Helen splashing away, evidently
enjoying her morning shower as she was
singing with many trills and folderols, trying
seemingly to hear herself above the noise of the
running water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Helen!&rdquo; thought Douglas. &ldquo;It is harder,
somehow, for her than any of us. Lucy is young
enough to learn the new trick of being poor very
easily, and Nan is such a philosopher; and dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
little Bobby won&rsquo;t see the difference just so he can
have plenty of mud to play in; and I&mdash;oh, well&mdash;I
have got so much to do I can&rsquo;t think about myself&mdash;I
must get up and do it, too. Here I am selfishly
lying in bed when I know Nan and Lucy
want to hear the news from Father just as much
as I did.&rdquo; So, slipping on a kimono, she ran into
the room across the hall, shared by the two
younger girls.</p>

<p>They were up and almost dressed. &ldquo;Lucy and
I thought maybe we could help, so we hurried. I
know you&rsquo;ve lots to do,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was dear of you both. Of course we
won&rsquo;t have so much to do right now, as we have
to wait for Dr. Wright to come home; and then
if we can rent the house furnished, we must get
everything in order. But first listen to the good
news!&rdquo; and she read the telegram.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that splendid and wasn&rsquo;t it kind of Dr.
Wright to send it to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so. If only Helen would not feel so
unkindly to him! She utterly refuses to like
him,&rdquo; and Douglas sighed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to like him either, then!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lucy. &ldquo;He shan&rsquo;t boss me if he isn&rsquo;t
going to boss Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absurd you are,&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;You
are so afraid that Helen will get something you
don&rsquo;t have that you won&rsquo;t even let her have a
private little dislike without wanting to have
some, too. I bet if Helen got the smallpox you
would think yourself abused if you didn&rsquo;t get
it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in your heart of hearts you know you do
like him,&rdquo; said Douglas with a severity that she
felt such silliness warranted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I do&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;maybe I do, I&rsquo;m not
going to take anything off of him that Helen
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon Dr. Wright will be glad to
wash his hands of us, anyhow,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see that it would be any sweet boon to look
after you and Helen or any of us, for that
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; laughed Douglas; &ldquo;but
you see his having power of attorney from Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
makes it necessary for us to consult with him
about some things, selling the automobile, for instance,
and renting the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selling the car!&rdquo; wailed Lucy. &ldquo;I think it is
foolishness to do that. I&rsquo;d like to know how you
are to occupy Dan, the chauffeur, if we haven&rsquo;t
a car to keep him busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you incorrigible girls! Of course we will
have to let the chauffeur go immediately; and
I&rsquo;ve got to tell the servants to-day that we can&rsquo;t
keep them. I&rsquo;ll give them all a week&rsquo;s warning,
of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand all that,&rdquo; said Nan, &ldquo;so please
don&rsquo;t bunch me in with the incorrigibles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Douglas, Oscar has been with us since
long before we were born. I don&rsquo;t see how you
can have the heart to dismiss him,&rdquo; and Lucy
looked resentfully at her older sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heart! I haven&rsquo;t the heart to let any of them
go, but it would be a great deal more heartless to
have them work for us with no money to pay
them with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Lucy Carter, you&rsquo;ve pretty near made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Douglas cry. You sound like a half-wit to me.
Heartless, indeed! If you had half of Douglas&rsquo;s
heart and one-fourth of her sense, you wouldn&rsquo;t
make such remarks,&rdquo; and Nan put her arms
around Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t make me cry, but what does
make me feel bad is that Lucy and Helen
can&rsquo;t even now realize the state of affairs. I
hated to have to tell Helen she mustn&rsquo;t
charge anything more, no matter what it is she
wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charge! I should say not! I think I would
walk on my uppers all the rest of my life before
I&rsquo;d put any more burden like that on Father,&rdquo; declared
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t people always charge when they
haven&rsquo;t got any money? What will we do when
we need things?&rdquo; asked Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do without,&rdquo; said Douglas wearily. She saw
it was going to take more than a few hours or a
few days to make two of her sisters realize the
necessity for reconstruction of their lives.
&ldquo;Helen and I are going right after breakfast to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
see real estate agents about getting us a tenant,
and Helen is going to purchase some cotton stockings.
She still persists in sticking to the letter of
her oath not to wear silk stockings until Daddy
is home and well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wear cotton stockings, too, if
Helen is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are, so are all of us, but we are going
to keep on with the ones we have until we go to
the country. Helen is spending her own money,
some she had, on these stockings and no one is
buying them for her,&rdquo; and Douglas went back to
her room to dress and take up the burden of the
day that was beginning to seem very heavy to
her young shoulders. &ldquo;If only Helen and Lucy
could see without being knocked down and made
to see,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Poor Father, if he had
only not been so unselfish how much better it
would have been for all of us now that we have
got to face life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>True to their determination, Douglas and
Helen went to several real estate agents. None
of them were very encouraging about renting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
during the summer months to reliable tenants, but
all of them promised to keep an eye open for the
young ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father gone off sick?&rdquo; asked one fatherly
old agent. &ldquo;Well, I saw him going to
pieces. Why, Robert Carter did the work of
three men. Just look at the small office force he
kept and the work he turned out! That meant
somebody did the drudgery, and that somebody
was the boss. What do the fellows in his office
think of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; stammered Douglas. She
couldn&rsquo;t let the kind old man know that she had
not even thought of informing the office of her
father&rsquo;s departure. How could she think of
everything?</p>

<p>Before seeing any more agents, she and Helen
betook themselves to their father&rsquo;s office, a
breezy apartment at the top of a great bank building.
Two young men were busily engaged on
some architectural drawings. They stopped work
and came eagerly forward to inquire for Mr.
Carter. Their consternation was great on hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of his sudden departure and their grief and
concern very evident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will do all we can to keep things going,&rdquo;
said the elder of the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet we will!&rdquo; from the other, who
had but recently been advanced from office
boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a big thing Mr. Carter has been
working on for some time, a competitive design
for a country club in North Carolina. It is
about done and I will do my best to finish it as I
think he would want it, and get it off. Did he
leave power of attorney with any one? You see,
Mr. Carter has two accounts, in different banks,
one, his personal account, and one, his business
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Wright, his physician, was given
power of attorney. There was no time to let
any of you know as it was important to have
Father kept very quiet, with no excitement. Dr.
Wright will come in to see you on Monday, I feel
sure. He does not get back from New York until
to-night.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;More work and responsibility for the doctor,&rdquo;
thought Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More power over us than we dreamed even,&rdquo;
was in Helen&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to rent our house, furnished, for the
summer, giving possession immediately, or almost
immediately,&rdquo; continued Douglas; &ldquo;perhaps
you may hear of some one who will be interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know of some one right now,&rdquo; eagerly put
in Dick, the promoted office boy. &ldquo;It is a family
who have been driven from Paris by the war.
They have been living there for years&mdash;got oodlums
of money and no place to spend it now, poor
things! They want a furnished house for six
months with privilege of renewing the lease for
a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, could you send them to me or me
to them right off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Carter, that&rsquo;s easy! If you go
home, I&rsquo;ll have the folks up there in an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How kind you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it! I&rsquo;m so glad I happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
know about them&mdash;and now you will be saved
an agent&rsquo;s fee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you think we should ask for
our house?&rdquo; said Douglas, appealing to both
young men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that house is as good a one as there is
in Richmond for its size,&rdquo; said Mr. Lane, the
elder. &ldquo;I know, because I helped on it. There
is not one piece of defective material in the whole
building. Even the nails were inspected. If it
had been on Franklin Street, I&rsquo;d say one hundred
a month, unfurnished, with all the baths it has
in it; but since it is not on Franklin, I believe one
hundred, furnished, would be a fair price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t that be fine, Douglas?&rdquo; spoke
Helen for the first time. She had been very
quiet while these business conferences had been
going on. &ldquo;That will be a whole lot of money.
Now we need not feel so poverty stricken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly families do live on less,&rdquo; and the
young man smiled. &ldquo;I think Mr. Carter usually
takes out about six hundred a month for his
household expenses&mdash;of course, that&rsquo;s not counting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
when he buys a car. I know it is none of my
business, but I am very much interested to know
what you young ladies are going to do with yourselves.
If I can be of any assistance, you must
call on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got the grandest scheme! I
thought of it myself, so I am vastly proud of it.
We are going up to Albemarle County, where
Father owns a tract of land right on the side of
a mountain, and there we are going to spend the
summer and take boarders and expect to make
a whole lot of money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take boarders? Is there a house there? I
understood from Mr. Carter that it was unimproved
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is. That is the beauty of it. We intend
to camp and all the boarders will camp,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young men could not contain themselves
but burst out laughing. They had not seen much
of their employer&rsquo;s family but they well knew
the luxurious lives they lived and their helplessness.
It was funny to hear this pretty butterfly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of a girl talking about taking boarders and making
money at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does sound funny,&rdquo; said Douglas when the
laugh in which she and Helen had joined subsided,
&ldquo;but we are really going to do it&mdash;that is,
I think we are,&rdquo; remembering that the Power of
Attorney had not yet been consulted and nothing
could really be determined on until then. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know about our making lots of money, but
we can certainly live much more cheaply camping
than any other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lane. &ldquo;Now maybe
this is where Dick and I can help. Camps have
to be built and we can get up some plans for you.
There is a book of them just issued and we can
get a working plan for you in short order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is splendid. We have a cousin, Lewis
Somerville, who is home now and has nothing to
do, and he is going up to Albemarle ahead of
us and build the camp. I&rsquo;ll tell him to come
down and see you and you can tell him all about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the girls, with many expressions of gratitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hastened home to prepare for the poor rich
people who had been driven from Paris and now
had no place to spend their money.</p>

<p>They stopped on Broad Street long enough for
Helen to spend one of her precious dollars for six
sixteen-and-two-third-cent stockings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it would be very extravagant if
I spent a dime in market for flowers?&rdquo; asked
Helen. &ldquo;It would make the house look more
cheerful and might make the poor rich people like
it better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, I don&rsquo;t think that would be very extravagant,&rdquo;
laughed Douglas.</p>

<p>So they went over to the Sixth Street market,
where the old colored women sit along the side-walk,
and purchased a gay bunch of wild phlox
for a dime. And then Helen could not resist
squandering another nickel for a branch of dogwood.
They jitneyed home, another extravagance.
There was no tangible reason why they
should not have ordered out their own car for
this business trip they had been forced to take,
but it had seemed to both of them a little incongruous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to ride in a seven-seated touring car on
the mission they had undertaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t gee with cotton stockings, somehow,&rdquo;
declared Helen, &ldquo;to step out of a good car
like ours. Jitneys are much more in keeping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exiles from Paris came with the faithful
Dick; liked the house; did not mind the price,
although furnished houses during the summer
months are somewhat a drug in the real estate
market; and were ready to close the bargain just
as soon as Dr. Wright should return.</p>

<p>The son, an æsthetic looking youth of seventeen,
who was Dick&rsquo;s acquaintance, was carried
away with the wild phlox and went into ecstasies
over the branch of dogwood which Helen had
placed near a Japanese print in the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it, Mamma! It is perfect!&rdquo; he exclaimed
as he stood enraptured by the effect.</p>

<p>Helen always declared that the market flowers
rented the house, and so they may have.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="f8">A COINCIDENCE.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Almost time for Dr. Wright!&rdquo; exclaimed
Douglas. &ldquo;I believe I heard the R.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;P. stop
at Elba. I do wonder what he is going to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going to say we are a set of fools and
lunatics and refuse to let us have any money to
start the camp. Since we have been so extravagant
and selfish for all these years, he&rsquo;ll think we
ought to go to the poor house, where we belong,&rdquo;
said Helen, frowning. &ldquo;I can see him now looking
through his eyebrows at me with the expression
of a hairy wildman in a show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright came with good news of the travelers.
He had not only seen them safely on
board but had sailed with them, coming back with
the pilot. He reported Mr. Carter as singularly
calm and rested already and Mrs. Carter as making
an excellent nurse. Evidently he was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
astonished that that poor lady could make herself
useful, and Helen, detecting his astonishment,
was immediately on the defensive; but as Dr.
Wright was addressing his remarks principally
to Douglas, almost ignoring her, she had no
chance to let him know what she thought of his
daring even to think slightingly of poor little
Mumsy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a scheme for you girls, too, if you
won&rsquo;t think I am presumptuous to be making suggestions,&rdquo;
he said, now including all four of the
sisters.</p>

<p>Of course, Douglas and Nan assured him that
they considered it very kind of him to think of
them at all, but Helen tossed her head and said
nothing. Lucy waited to see what Helen would
do and did the same thing, but she could not help
smiling at the young doctor when he laughed out-right
at her ridiculous mimicry of Helen. He
flushed, however, showing he was not quite so
callous to Helen&rsquo;s scorn and distrust as he would
have liked to appear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the wisest thing for you to do would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
be to rent this house, furnished, if you can find
a tenant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen triumphantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, we have got a tenant if you think it is
best,&rdquo; explained Douglas. &ldquo;We were going to
do nothing without your approval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now! I have no jurisdiction over
you,&rdquo; laughed the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t power of attorney jurisdiction?&rdquo; asked
Lucy. &ldquo;Nan says I can&rsquo;t have any more stockings
until you permit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well! I must be a terrible bugaboo to
you! I don&rsquo;t feel at all qualified to judge of your
stockings, little girl, or anything else pertaining
to the female attire. It was the merest accident
that I was given power of attorney. I am not in
the least an appropriate person to be having it. I
only consented to have it wished on me when I
saw your father was becoming excited and tired
over the unexpected hitch when the notary spoke
of Miss Douglas&rsquo;s not being of age. I have
transferred what cash your father has to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sister&rsquo;s account. I must find out from you whom
you want to look after your affairs and consult
that person&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Dr. Wright, we would lots rather have
you, if you don&rsquo;t mind!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas.
&ldquo;Any of our kinsmen that we might call on would
insist upon our coming to live with them or make
us go to some stuffy boarding house or something.
They would not look at it as I believe you
would at all. We have a scheme, too, but we
want to hear yours first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My scheme was, as I say, first to rent your
house, furnished, and then all of you, with some
suitable older person and some man whom you
can trust, go and camp out on the side of the
mountain in Albemarle. What do you say
to it?&rdquo; The girls burst out laughing, even
Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright, this is absolutely uncanny!&rdquo; exclaimed
Douglas. &ldquo;That is exactly what we
were planning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only we were going you some better and were
to have boarders,&rdquo; drawled Nan.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Boarders, eh, and what do you know about
keeping boarders?&rdquo; laughed the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know enough not to do the way we have
been done by at summer boarding houses where
we have been sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is that I think you are a
pretty spunky lot. Please tell me which one of
you thought up this plan. There must surely
have been a current of mental telepathy flowing
from one of you girls to me. It was you, I fancy,
Miss Douglas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am never so quick to see a way out. It
was Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Helen thought of it, but I came mighty
near doing it,&rdquo; declared Lucy. &ldquo;I would have
done it all the way but I went to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen looked as though she did not at all relish
having anything even so intangible as a current
of mental telepathy connecting her with one
whom she was still determined to look upon as an
enemy. He was gazing at her with anything but
the eyes of an enemy, however, and Nan&rsquo;s remark
about his eyes looking like blue flowers high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
up on a cliff that you must climb to reach, came
back to her. She felt that those flowers were in
easy reach for her now; that all she had to do
to make this rugged young man her friend was
to be decently polite. But her pride was still
hurt from his former disapproval and while his
present attitude was much better, she still could
not bring herself to smile at him. She was very
quiet while the other girls unfolded their plans
for the camp. She did not take so much pleasure
in it now that it was not altogether her scheme.
To think that while she was working it up this
bumptious young doctor was doing the same
thing!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The keeping boarders part of it was mine,
though,&rdquo; she comforted herself by thinking.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright was really astonished by the quickness
with which these spoiled girls had acted and
their eagerness to begin to be something besides
the butterflies they had seemed. Douglas told
him of the plans for the camp that the assistant
in the office was to draw for them, and then
showed him some of the advertisements of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
boarding camp that Nan had been working on all
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is sure to draw a crowd of eager week-enders,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;In fact, I believe you will
have more boarders than the mountain will
hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it best to have kind of catchy ads
that would make people wonder what we were up
to anyhow,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;Now this one is sure to
draw a crowd: &lsquo;A week-end boarding camp,
where one can have all of the discomforts of
camping without the responsibility.&rsquo; Here is
another: &lsquo;Mountain air makes you hungry!
Come to The Week-End Camp and let us feed
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; laughed the young man. &ldquo;But please
tell me how you plan to feed the hungry hordes
that are sure to swarm to your camp. Do you
know how to cook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen can make angel&rsquo;s food and I know how
to make mayonnaise, but sometimes it goes back
on me,&rdquo; said Nan with the whimsical air that
always drew a smile from Dr. Wright.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can make angel&rsquo;s food, too,&rdquo; declared Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, angel&rsquo;s food and mayonnaise will be
enough surely for hungry hordes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, we are going to take some servants
with us,&rdquo; said Helen, breaking the vow of silence
that she was trying to keep in Dr. Wright&rsquo;s presence.
&ldquo;Old Oscar, our butler, and Susan, the
housemaid, have both volunteered to go. I can
make more things than angel&rsquo;s food, and, besides,
I am going to learn how to do all kinds of things
before we go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, you can make devil&rsquo;s food,&rdquo; teased
Nan. &ldquo;Somehow I didn&rsquo;t like to mention it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cook is going to teach me to make all kinds
of things. I am going to get dinner to-morrow
and have already made up bread for breakfast.
I am going to buy some of the cutest little bungalow
aprons to cook in, pink and blue. I saw
them down town this morning. They are what
made me think of learning how to cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to learn how to cook, too, and I
must have some aprons just like Helen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of us are Camp Fire Girls,&rdquo; said Douglas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to the doctor, &ldquo;and of course we have learned
some of the camping stunts, but we have not been
as faithful as we might have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an old camper and can put you on to
many things if you will let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should be only too glad,&rdquo; responded
Douglas sincerely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the first things is canvas cots. Don&rsquo;t
try to sleep on all kinds of contrived beds. Get
folding cots and insure comfortable nights. Another
is, don&rsquo;t depend altogether on camp fires
for cooking. Kerosene stoves and fireless cookers
come in mighty handy for steady meal getting.
It will be another month at least before
you go, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just about, I think, if we can manage it. We
have school to finish and I have some college
exams that I want to take, although I see no prospect
of college yet. Another thing I want to discuss
with you, Dr. Wright, is selling our car. I
think that might bring in money enough for us to
pay for all the camp fixtures and run us for
awhile.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I&rsquo;ll see about that for you immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man took his departure with a
much higher opinion of the Carter sisters than
he had held twenty-four hours before. As for
the Carter sisters: they felt so grateful to him
for his kindness to their parents and to them that
their opinion of him was perforce good. Helen
still sniffed disdainfully when his name was mentioned,
but she could not forget the expression of
approval in his blue eyes when he found that the
camping scheme was hers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="f8">GWEN.</span></h2>


<p>Bill Tinsley was as keen on the camp building
plan as Lewis Somerville had said he would be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleeping on my arms,&rdquo; was his telegram in
answer to the letter he got from Lewis, a letter
with R. S. V. P. P. D. Q. plainly marked on the
envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good old Bill! I almost knew he would tumble
at the chance. All of you will like Bill, I
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he mean by sleeping on his arms?&rdquo;
asked Lucy. &ldquo;I should think it would make him
awfully stiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that means ready to go at a moment&rsquo;s
notice. I bet his kit is packed now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lane and Dick had worked hard on the
plans for the camp and had them ready when the
would-be builder called for them. Then Mr.
Lane and Lewis made a flying trip to Greendale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to look into the lay of the land and to decide on
a site for the dining pavilion. It was a spot
about one hundred yards from the log cabin,
built by the aforesaid sick Englishman, that
seemed to them to be intended for just their purpose.
It was a hollowed out place in the mountain
side, not far from the summit, and four
great pine trees formed an almost perfect rectangle
of forty by twenty-five feet. In the centre
stood a noble tulip poplar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity to sacrifice him,&rdquo; said Bill Tinsley,
whom they had picked up at Charlottesville on
their way to Greendale. Bill was a youth of few
words but of frequent mirth expressed in uncontrollable
fits of laughter that nothing could stop,
not even being shipped from West Point. It was
this very laugh that had betrayed the hazers. If
Bill had only been able to hold in that guffaw of
his they would never have been caught. His
laugh was unmistakable and through it the whole
crowd of wrongdoers was nabbed, poor Lewis
along with them although he was innocent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more to blame for laughing than a lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
bug for shining,&rdquo; he had declared to Lewis;
&ldquo;but I wish I had died before I got you into this,
old fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped, but I bet you will be
laughing on the other side of your face before
you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youths had remained fast friends and now
that this chance had come for them to be of service
and to use the surplus energy that was
stored up in their splendidly developed muscles,
they were happy at the prospect of being together
again.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane took careful measurements and
adapted his plans so as to utilize the four trees as
natural posts and the great tulip poplar as a support
for the roof. Under the pavilion the space
was to be made into kitchen and store room.
Some little excavating would be necessary for
this as measurements showed that one edge of the
pavilion would rest almost on the mountain side
while the other stood ten feet from the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to spare you fellows all the excavating
possible, as that is the tedious and uninteresting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
part of building,&rdquo; explained Mr.
Lane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can shovel that little pile of dirt away
in no time,&rdquo; declared Lewis, feeling his muscles
twitch with joy at the prospect of removing
mountains. Mr. Lane smiled, knowing full well
that it was at least no mole hill they were to
tackle.</p>

<p>Within a week after Mr. and Mrs. Carter had
sailed on their health-seeking voyage, Lewis and
his chum were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Greendale, all of the
lumber for their undertaking ordered and their
tools sent on ahead by freight. Bill had gone to
Richmond, ostensibly to consult a dentist, but in
reality to see the Carter girls, who had aroused
in him a great curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be some girls,&rdquo; had been his laconic
remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they are, the very best fun you ever saw,&rdquo;
Lewis had assured him. &ldquo;They took this thing
of waking up and finding themselves poor a
great deal better than you and I did waking
up and finding ourselves nothing but civilians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
when we had expected to be major generals, at
least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Carter girls had one and all liked Bill,
when Lewis took him to call on them the evening
of his arrival in Richmond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something so frank and open in his
countenance,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mouth!&rdquo; drawled Nan. &ldquo;Did you ever
see or hear such a laugh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a great deal nicer than your old Dr.
Wright, who looks as though it would take an
operation on his risibles to get a laugh out of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bill had offered the services of a battered Ford
car he had in Charlottesville as pack mule for the
camp and it was joyfully accepted. He and
Lewis stopped in Charlottesville on their way to
Greendale and got the tried old car, making the
last leg of their trip in it.</p>

<p>They had decided to sleep in the Englishman&rsquo;s
cabin, as the little log house that went with the
property was always called, but Miss Somerville
had made them promise to burn sulphur candles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
before they went in and was deeply grieved because
her beloved nephew refused to carry with
him a quart bottle of crude carbolic acid that she
felt was necessary to ward off germs.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon as the faithful
Ford chugged its way up the mountain road to
the site of the proposed camp. The boys had
stopped at the station at Greendale and taken in
all the tools they could stow away, determined to
begin work at excavating the first thing in the
morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s lay out the ground this afternoon,&rdquo; proposed
Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to lay out since the four pine
trees mark the corners. I, for one, am going to
lay out myself and rest and try to decide which
one of your cousins is the most beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas, of course! The others can&rsquo;t hold a
candle to her, although Helen is some looker and
Nan has certainly got something about her that
makes a fellow kind of blink. And that Lucy is
going to grow up to her long legs some day and
maybe step ahead of all of them.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m mighty glad you thought about giving
me this job of working for such nice gals.&rdquo;
These young men always spoke of themselves as
being in the employ of the Carter girls, and all
the time they were building the camp they religiously
kept themselves to certain hours as
though any laxity would be cheating their bosses.
Besides, the regular habits that two years at
West Point had drilled into them would have
been difficult to break.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to loaf,&rdquo; complained Lewis.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dickens of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, neither!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say the Government makes machines of
its men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True! I am a perpetual motion machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were busily engaged on their first morning
in the mountains, plying pick and shovel.
They bent their brave young shoulders to the
task with evident enjoyment in the work. When
they did straighten up to get the kinks out of
their backs, they looked out across a wonderful
country which they fully appreciated as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
wonderful, but raving about landscapes and Nature
was not in their line and they would quickly
bend again to the task in a somewhat shamefaced
way.</p>

<p>The orchards of Albemarle County in Virginia
are noted and the green of an apple tree in
May is something no one need be ashamed to admire
openly, but all these boys would say on the
subject was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good apple year, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep! Albemarle pippins are sho&rsquo; good eats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moving mountains was not quite so easy as
they had expected it to be. They remembered
what Mr. Lane had said about excavating when
the sun showed it to be high noon and after
five hours&rsquo; steady work they had made but
little impression on the pile they were to dig
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, we make no impression at all!&rdquo; said
Lewis. &ldquo;I verily believe little Bobby Carter
could have done as much as we have if he had
been turned loose to play mud pies here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s stop and eat. I haven&rsquo;t laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for an hour,&rdquo; and Bill gave out one of his guffaws
that echoed from peak to peak and started
two rabbits out of the bushes and actually dislodged
a great stone that went rolling down the
side of the mountain into an abyss below. At
least, his laugh seemed to be the cause but Bill
declared it was somebody or something, and to
be sure a little mountain boy came from behind
a boulder, grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What be you uns a-doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crocheting a shawl for Aunty,&rdquo; said Lewis
solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we uns is got a mule an&rsquo; a scoop that
could make a shawl fer Aunty quicker&rsquo;n you
uns.&rdquo; This brought forth another mighty peal
from Bill and another stone rolled down the
mountain side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, son!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis. &ldquo;Suppose
you fetch the mule here this afternoon and
we&rsquo;ll have a sewing bee. What do you say, Bill?
Do you believe we would ever in the world get
this dirt moved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubt it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you uns want we uns to drive the critter?
We uns mostly goes along &rsquo;thout no axtra
chawge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we want you. What do you charge for
the mule and driver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, time was when Josephus brought as
much as fifty cents a day, but he ain&rsquo;t to say so
spry as onct, an&rsquo; now we uns will be satisfied to
git thirty cents, with a feedin&rsquo; of oats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oats! Who has oats? Not I. The only
critter we have eats gasoline. I tell you, son, you
feed Josephus yourself and we will feed you and
pay you fifty cents a day for your animal. I
don&rsquo;t believe a mule could work for thirty cents
and keep his self-respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, Josephus an&rsquo; we uns don&rsquo;t want no
money what we uns don&rsquo; arn,&rdquo; and the little
mountain boy flushed a dark red under his sunburned,
freckled face.</p>

<p>He was a very ragged youngster of about
twelve. His clothes smacked of the soil to such
an extent that you could never have told what
was their original color. What sleeves there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
were left in his shirt certainly must once have
been blue, but the body of that garment showed
spots of candy pink calico, the kind you are sure
to find on the shelves of any country store. His
trousers, held up by twine, crossed over his wiry
shoulders, were corduroy. They had originally
been the color of the earth and time and weather
had but deepened their tone. His eyes shone out
very clear and blue in contrast to the general dinginess
of his attire. His was certainly a very
likable face and the young men were very much
attracted to the boy, first because of his ready
wit, shown from his first words, and then because
of his quick resentment at the possibility of
any one&rsquo;s giving him or his mule money they had
not earned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you are going to earn it,&rdquo; reassured
Lewis. &ldquo;Now you go home and get your
mule and as soon as we can cook some dinner for
ourselves and satisfy our inner cravings, we will
all get to work. You and Josephus can dig and
Bill and I will begin to build.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, wouldn&rsquo;t you uns like Gwen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cook for you uns and wash the platters an&rsquo; sich?
She is a great han&rsquo; at fixin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gwen! Who is Gwen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another stone slipped from behind the boulder
from which the boy had emerged and then a
young girl came timidly forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Gwen,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>

<p>She was a girl of about fourteen, very slim and
straight, with wide grey eyes that looked very
frankly into those of the young men, although
you felt a timidity in spite of her directness.
Her scant blue dress was clean and whole and
her brown hair was parted and braided in two
long plaits, showing much care and brushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you do, Miss Gwen? I am Lewis
Somerville and this is my friend and fellow laborer,
Mr. William Tinsley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl made a little old-fashioned courtesy
with a quaint grace that charmed the laborers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to cook and clean for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we do! What can you cook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have learned to cook some very good dishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
at the Mountain Mission School. Maybe you
would not like them, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we would like them! When can
you start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you wish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish now,&rdquo; put in Bill. &ldquo;I never
tasted meaner coffee than you made last night
except what I made myself this morning, and as
for your method of broiling bacon&mdash;rotten&mdash;rotten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl followed Lewis to the Englishman&rsquo;s
cabin and after being shown the provisions, she
said she thought she could manage to get dinner
without his assistance. He showed her how to
light the hard alcohol stove which was part of
their outfit and then gave her carte blanche with
the canned goods and groceries.</p>

<p>Gwen shook her head in disapproval at sight
of the pile of dirty dishes left from breakfast.
It would take more than West Point training to
make men wash dishes as soon as a meal is over.
Lewis and Bill had a method of their own and
never washed a plate until both sides had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
eaten from, and not then until they were needed
immediately. Supper had been eaten from the
top side; breakfast, from the bottom. There
were still some clean plates in the hamper, so
why wash those yet?</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time Gwen called the
young men to dinner. They lay stretched at their
ease on a grassy slope near the cabin, quite
pleased with themselves and their luck in having
found a mule to move the dirt and a girl to cook
their food all in one morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you make of her?&rdquo; asked Lewis.
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t talk or walk like a mountain girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mission School!&rdquo; commented Bill, looking at
the slim, erect back of the girl as she went up the
hill to the spring. She had refused their offer
of help and said she wanted to get the water herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mission School would have her
walking that way. Don&rsquo;t you fancy the boy goes
to school, too? Look how he slouches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the boy, whose name was Josh, appeared,
leading Josephus. Surely there never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
was such a specimen of horse flesh as that mule.
Maud in the comic supplement was beautiful
compared to him. His legs had great lumps on
them and he was forced to walk with his feet
quite far apart to keep from interfering. He
was sway backed and spavined and blind in one
eye, but there was a kindly expression in his remaining
eye that reassured one. One fore leg
was shorter than the other, which gave him a
leaning, tumbling look that seemed to threaten
to upset his equilibrium at every step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, God bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis.
&ldquo;Is that Josephus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir! He ain&rsquo;t so measly as he looks.
He kin do a sight of scrapin&rsquo; an&rsquo; dumpin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and
the boy reached an affectionate arm up around
the old animal&rsquo;s neck. Josephus responded by
snorting in his master&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;We uns done
brought the implee-ment to make Aunty&rsquo;s
shawl,&rdquo; pointing to a rusty old road shovel that
Josephus had hitched to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! as soon as Miss Gwen feeds us, we will
see what he can do in the way of fancy work.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Gwen was a born cook and the domestic science
that had been so ably taught in the Mission
School had developed her talent wonderfully.
She had turned up two empty boxes and
smoothed some wrapping paper over them. A
bunch of mountain laurel glorified an old soup
can and made a beautiful centre piece. The coffee
was hot and clear and strong; the hoecake
brown and crisp on the outside and soft and
creamy within, just as a hoecake should be; the
bacon vied with the hoecake in crispness, with no
pieces limp and none burned. She had opened
a can of baked beans and another of spaghetti,
carefully following the directions on the cans
as how to serve the contents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t this beat all?&rdquo; said Bill as he
sank down by the improvised table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must come and eat with us, you and
Josh,&rdquo; insisted Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, the table isn&rsquo;t big enough, and, besides,
I must go on baking hoecakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Josh, you come, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, thanky! We uns will wait for Gwen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
We uns ain&rsquo;t fitten to sit down with the likes of
you uns, all dirty with we uns&rsquo; meat a-stickin&rsquo;
through the rags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Lewis, &ldquo;if you are fit
to sit with Miss Gwen, you are fit to sit with us.
We don&rsquo;t mind your meat sticking through, and
as for being dirty&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you wash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gwen gave a laugh of delight. &ldquo;There now,
Josh, what do I tell you all the time? Rags don&rsquo;t
make a bit of difference if you are just clean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, we uns&rsquo;ll eat with Josephus if we uns
has to wash. This ain&rsquo;t no time of the week for
washin&rsquo;.&rdquo; But while the young men were enjoying
the very appetizing food, Josh did sneak
off to the stream and came back with his face and
hands several shades fairer.</p>

<p>That afternoon was a busy one for all on that
mountain side. Gwen gave the cabin a thorough
cleaning, washed all the dishes and put papers
on the shelves that were already in the cabin, unpacked
the provisions and placed them with the
dishes neatly on the shelves and in the old cupboard
that still stood in the corner, left there by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the Englishman. She went back to her home for
yeast and made up a sponge, planning to have hot
rolls for breakfast.</p>

<p>Josephus showed the mettle of his pasture by
scraping and dumping about three times as much
dirt in an hour as the two West Pointers had
been able to move in a whole morning&rsquo;s work.
Josh did very spirited driving, pretending all the
time that his steed had to be handled very carefully
or he would run away, road-shovel and all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did your mule happen to have one leg
shorter than the other?&rdquo; teased Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, that&rsquo;s a mounting leg. He got that
walkin&rsquo; round the mounting. All critters in the
mountings is built that a way. Ain&rsquo;t you an&rsquo;
Mr. Bill there a-planning that there buildin&rsquo; after
we unses&rsquo; mule, with short legs up the hill an&rsquo; long
legs down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bill almost fell out of the poplar tree where he
had climbed to saw off limbs for twenty feet or
more. He laughed so loud and long at the way
Josh had gotten ahead of his friend in repartee
that Gwen came out of the cabin to see what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the matter. Bill&rsquo;s laugh was a very disconcerting
thing until you got used to him.</p>

<p>That first day showed much accomplished.
The excavating was half done; the post holes
were dug and logs cut and trimmed and planted
ready for the beams. A load of lumber arrived
before sundown and that meant no delay in the
to-morrow&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Six o&rsquo;clock found them very tired and hungry
but Gwen had supper all ready for them, a great
dish of scrambled eggs and flannel cakes. She
had brought from home a pitcher of milk
that stayed delightfully cool in the mountain
spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be buttermilk to-morrow,&rdquo; she said,
blushing with pleasure at the praise the young
men bestowed on her culinary efforts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid and more splendid!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lewis. &ldquo;And will you and your brother just
come every day and take care of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Josh? He is not my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cousin, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is no relation to me. I live with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
mother, though, Aunt Mandy. I have lived with
her for five years. I am very fond of Josh, but
if he were my brother, I&rsquo;d simply make him take
baths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you anyhow as it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sadly. &ldquo;He thinks it is foolishness.
Teacher has told him time and time again and
even sent him home, five miles across the mountains,
but he won&rsquo;t wash for her or for me.
Aunt Mandy thinks it is foolishness, too, but
she makes him bathe oftener than he used to in
summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys will be boys and it is hard to make them
anything else. I remember the time well when
bathing was something that I thought grown-ups
wished on me just for spite, and now a cold
shower every morning is as necessary to my happiness
as dirt used to be when I was a kid. Bill
and I are going to pipe from the spring up there
and concoct a shower somehow under the
pavilion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be glorious. Father always meant
to use that spring and get a shower at the cabin.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my father was the man who built the
Englishman&rsquo;s cabin. He died five years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whilikins! Now I understand!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="f8">SOME LETTERS.</span></h2>


<p class="center">From Lewis Somerville to Douglas Carter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"> Greendale, Va., May &mdash;, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>Dear Douglas:</p>

<p>Bill and I are coming on finely. Already the
noble palace is rearing its head. We&rsquo;ve got the
posts planted and the uprights and rafters in
place and will begin on the roof to-morrow. Bill
is a perfect glutton for work. Speaking of gluttons&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
got a cook. A perfect gem of a
cook who has been born and bred at Lonesomehurst
and doesn&rsquo;t mind the country. We are going
to hang on to her like grim Death to a dead
nigger.</p>

<p>The funny thing about her is she is a real lady.
I spotted it from the beginning from a certain
way she had with her. She is only fourteen and
her father, who, by the way, was the Englishman
who built this cabin and used to own the side of
the mountain, has been dead five years; but before
he died this child evidently learned to eat
with a fork and to take a daily bath and to keep
her hair smooth. She handles the King&rsquo;s English
with the same respect and grace she does a
fork, and her speech is very marked because of
the contrast between it and the we uns and you
uns and you allses of the ordinary mountaineer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
She has lived ever since her father&rsquo;s death with
Aunt Mandy, a regular old mountain character
who looks as though she might have stepped out
of one of John Fox&rsquo;s books. She is the same
back and front, concave both ways&mdash;slightly
more convex in the back than the front. She
stands a good six feet in her stocking feet (although
I doubt her ever having on a pair). I
have never seen her without a snuff stick in her
mouth except once and then she had a corn-cob
pipe. She is as sharp as a tack and woe be to
the one who engages her in a contest of wit.</p>

<p>Josh is her son and Josephus her mule. Mr.
Mandy is dead, and Aunt Mandy and Josh, who
is twelve, I think, have scratched a living out of
their &ldquo;clarin&rsquo;&rdquo; with the help of Josephus, who is
as much of a character as Aunt Mandy and Josh.</p>

<p>When the Englishman died, Aunt Mandy took
the little orphan Gwendolin to her house, never
dreaming that there was anything for her to do
but take her. She has been as good as gold to
the girl and shared her corn pone and drippings
with a heart of charity. Gwen is surely making
up to her now for all her kindness as she does
all the housework for her foster mother and all
kinds of sewing and knitting, which she sells to
the summer boarders down at the hotel at Greendale.
I am crazy to engage Gwen and Josh for
you girls but am afraid of butting in on your
arrangements.</p>

<p>Josh is delicious. He did not learn to wash
from an English father nor to handle a fork, nor
yet to speak the King&rsquo;s English&mdash;but good old
Aunt Mandy has endowed him plentifully with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
keen wit and as good and kind a heart as she herself
has. Maybe he does not speak the King&rsquo;s
English but one thing sure: the King himself
could not boast a finer sense of honor and pride.</p>

<p>I have done one thing that may be butting in,
but it seems to me to be so necessary that I am
sure you will forgive me: I have had Josh and
Josephus plow up a piece of land on top the
mountain, where the Englishman once had a garden,
and there I have planned to set out a lot of
vegetables. It is late to start a garden but there
are lots of things that will come in mighty handy
for you when you have a camp full of boarders.
This was Gwen&rsquo;s suggestion. Aunt Mandy and
Josh are enlarging their garden with a hope of
selling things to you and they are also planning
to sell you milk. I say all right to that, provided
Gwen does the milking, but I am sure if Josh does
it, it will look like cocoa by the time we get it,
no matter how much it is strained. He is certainly
one dirty boy but I comfort myself with
the thought that it is clean Mother Earth dirt,
the kind Bobby gets on him, and, after all, that
isn&rsquo;t so germy.</p>

<p>We are having glorious weather and I do wish
you girls could be here, but no doubt if you were,
we would not eat up work quite so fast as we are
doing now. We are enjoying ourselves greatly
and are getting over our terrible disappointment.
If Uncle Sam doesn&rsquo;t want us to soldier for him
in times of peace we will show him what we are
good for in times of war. I did think right seriously
of enlisting with the Canadians and going
over to help the Allies, but somehow I have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
feeling I won&rsquo;t butt in on Europe&rsquo;s troubles but
wait for one of our own which is sure to turn
up sooner or later. In the meantime, thanks to
you girls, we work so hard in the day time that
when night comes there is nothing to do but
sleep. I could sleep on a rock pile I am so tired,
but instead of a rock pile, a nice canvas cot serves
me very well. We have all kinds of schemes for
comfort but I am not going to tell you of them as
they may not pan out as we expect, and then if
they do come right, we can surprise you with
them.</p>

<p>Bill sends his regards. He stayed awake for
a little while one night trying to decide which one
of you was the most beautiful, but as he had to
give it up, he has lost no more sleep on the subject.
One thing that makes us work so hard is
that we feel that as soon as we get the place habitable
you will come and inhabit. My love to the
girls and Bobby. Tell him there is so much mischief
he can get in up here, I know he is going
to have the time of his life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Richmond, Va.</p>

<p>My dear Nephew:</p>

<p>Your letters have been most satisfactory and I
am deeply grateful to you for writing so frequently
and in such detail. I spent yesterday
afternoon with the Carter girls and Douglas read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
me your last letter to her. I must say your description
of the mountain woman and her son is
far from pleasant.</p>

<p>You are very much mistaken, germs do lurk
in the earth. Tetanus and hookworm are both
taken in directly from the earth, and meningitis
is considered by some of the best authorities to
be a product of rotting wood. Did the Englishman
die of T.&nbsp;B.? If he did, no power on earth
will make me sleep in that cabin. The daughter
no doubt has inherited the disease from her parent
and is this moment stirring the dread germ
into your batter cakes. She sounds to be very
industrious and efficient. Do not praise her too
much but remember: &ldquo;A new broom sweeps
clean.&rdquo; Please find out from this girl what was
the matter with her father. Did you burn the
sulphur candles?</p>

<p>The Carter&rsquo;s tenants take possession of their
house next week and then all of the girls and that
Bobby, who is certainly a living illustration of
&ldquo;Spare the rod and spoil the child,&rdquo; will come to
me until it is time to go to the mountains. It will
be quite a care for me, but I do not forget that
my mother, your grandmother, was brought up
in their grandfather&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Cast your bread
upon the waters and after many days,&rdquo; etc. Old
Cousin Robert Carter left no money but many
debts, debts to himself just like this one that I
owe him.</p>

<p>Please let me know by return mail what was
the matter with the Englishman and if he died
of T.&nbsp;B.&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Your devoted</span><br />

<p class="center">Telegram from Lewis Somerville to his Aunt
Lizzie.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>


<p class="center">From Douglas Carter to Lewis Somerville.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Richmond, Va., May &mdash;, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>My dear Lewis:</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know how we appreciate your kindness
in going up to the mountains and working so
hard for us. We feel as though we could never
repay you and Mr. Tinsley for your kindness.
Everything you have to say about the camp
sounds delightful. As for your butting in&mdash;you
know you couldn&rsquo;t do that. If you think Josh
and the little English girl would be good ones to
have for the Week-End Boarding Camp, why
you just engage them. We are so inexperienced
that sometimes I think we are perfectly crazy to
undertake this thing, but then I think if the
boarders don&rsquo;t like our ways they don&rsquo;t have to
stay, and certainly one week-end would not kill
them. They don&rsquo;t have to come back, either.</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s funny ads have called forth all kinds of
replies and already we have many applications
for board. One woman wants us to take care of
her six children as she wants to go to the war
zone as Red Cross nurse. We had to turn that
down as Bobby will be about all we can manage
in the way of kids. She only wanted to pay two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
full boards for the six children as she declared
their ages aggregated only thirty-seven, which
would not be as much as two full grown persons.</p>

<p>Some of our school friends are eager to go,
and as Cousin Lizzie has a reputation for being
a very strict chaperone, their mothers are willing.
Mr. Lane and Dick, the two young men in
Father&rsquo;s office, are both coming up when they
can and they are going to send us some of their
friends.</p>

<p>While you have been working so hard, we, too,
have not been idle. Of course, school has kept
me very busy as I am anxious to take my exams
and make all the points I can for college, whether
I am to go next year or not. Helen has decided
that her schooling just now is of very little importance
since she has no idea of going in for
college, so she has simply quit; but she is very
busy, busier than any of us perhaps. She is
learning all the cooking that our cook can teach
her in the few days she is to be with us, and she
has also joined a domestic science class at the
Y.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. and has added jelly roll and chocolate
pie to her list of culinary accomplishments.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright made a splendid suggestion: that
each one of us learns to cook a meal, a different
menu for each girl. If we do that, we can
change about and give the boarders some variety,
and then the responsibility would not rest
too heavily on any one of us. Nan and I are trying
it and on Saturday I am to serve the family
a dinner under cook&rsquo;s directions. Helen, of
course, scorns Dr. Wright&rsquo;s suggestion and Lucy
says she won&rsquo;t learn anything Helen won&rsquo;t.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Susan, this housegirl who is to go with us, cannot
cook at all, but we are to have her wash the
dishes and make up beds, or cots, and set the
tables, etc. Oscar will wait on the table and help
with the dishes.</p>

<p>We are looking out for a cook, but the trouble
is good cooks are already cooking. This old woman
who has been with us for years is weeping
all the time because she is too afraid of snakes to
go to the mountains. I have found her a good
home and next week she leaves us. Oscar says
he can cook but he has lived with us, as Lucy
says, since before we were born, and no one has
ever known of his so much as making a cup of tea
or a piece of toast, and I am afraid that he has
hid his light under a bushel for so long that it
has perhaps gone out.</p>

<p>We have sold the car and all debts are paid,
and we have a tidy little sum to buy camping outfits
and also provisions. Mr. Lane assures me
that the store room will be large enough for a
quantity of provisions, so we are ordering everything
by the barrel, except pepper, of course. It
saves a lot and Schmidt pays the freight. We
already have a list as long as I am of things we
have to get, and every day one of us thinks of
more things.</p>

<p>We are filled with admiration for you that you
should have thought of a garden. Have you
looked into the matter of chickens? I remember
when we have boarded in the country chickens
were what we and all the other boarders clamored
for. I want to have fried chicken on my
menu that I am to learn to cook, but they are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
terribly high now in town that I shall have to
put in a substitute and learn how to fry chickens
when they get cheaper, which they will surely do
later on.</p>

<p>Dear Cousin Lizzie, who has been kindness
itself, is to take us to her home after this week,
where we will stay until we go to the mountains.
It is so good of her to go with us. I just know
she hates it and we must all of us try to make
things as easy for her as possible. Will the
cabin be comfortable? When the other things
are freighted, I am going to send a little iron bed
with a good mattress, also an easy chair for her
to be comfortable in.</p>

<p>Please remember me to Mr. Tinsley. All the
girls send messages to both of you.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Very sincerely,</span><br />

<p class="center">From Mrs. Carter to her children.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>My darling children:</p>

<p>I am writing this on the steamer but expect to
mail it at Bermuda. You are in my thoughts
every moment, but my dreams of you are so sweet
and peaceful that somehow I feel that you are all
right. I know you are anxious about your beloved
father and I am very happy to tell you that
he is much better. It seems that every day puts
new life in him. At first he lay so quiet and slept
so much that a strange dread filled my heart.
The young surgeon on board, who is a friend of
Dr. Wright, assured me that sleep was the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thing for him, but while he slept, I would get so
lonely that I could hardly stand it. I had time
to think much of what a poor wife I have been
to him and foolish mother to all of you. I have
not worried him with my grievance against myself,
however, and I am not going to worry you,
but am going to be less selfish with him and may
even be stricter with you. He lets me wait on
him now and he thinks it is a great joke to lie
still and ask me to bring water or to fill his pipe
or do something equally easy.</p>

<p>Sometimes he worries about his business, but
I won&rsquo;t let him talk about it. He thinks he hasn&rsquo;t
any money left, but of course I know that is nonsense.
Dr. Wright told me he would look after
you girls and see that you were well taken care
of. As for money,&mdash;why, you don&rsquo;t need much
cash and our credit at the shops is perfectly good,
and you can get what you need. If you summer
in the mountains, which is what Dr. Wright
hinted you might do, you must all of you have
plenty of little afternoon frocks. I hate to see
girls at the springs wear the same clothes morning
and afternoon. Don&rsquo;t be dowdy, I pray of
you.</p>

<p>You had better take Susan wherever you go
so she can look after Bobby, who is too large for
a nurse, I know, but who needs much attention.
Susan can look after your clothes, too, and do
up your lace collars and keep your boots cleaned.
Keep the other servants in town on full pay and
be sure that they have plenty of provisions. I
think nothing is so horrid as the habit some persons
have of letting servants shift for themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
while they are off enjoying themselves at the
springs.</p>

<p>I am hoping for letters when we land at Bermuda.
I am hungry for news of all of you.
Your poor father talks a great deal of you and
wants to go over incidents of your childhood.
He says he is relying on your good sense to keep
you from harm until we return.</p>

<p>We both of us liked Dr. Wright very much,&mdash;at
least, your father liked him. I was too afraid
of him to call it liking but I trusted him implicitly,
and now that your father is so much better, I
know that his treatment was exactly the right
thing. This young surgeon on board says that
Dr. Wright is one of the very finest young men
in the profession and his friends expect great
things of him.</p>

<p>Our quarters are very comfortable and, strange
to say, although the food is far from dainty, I am
enjoying it very much. It is well cooked and
everything is spotlessly clean. They have room
for only thirty passengers on this boat as it is
entirely given up to freight. This young surgeon
has accepted a position on the boat so he can
have time to do some writing he is deep in.</p>

<p>It is a very lazy, peaceful life and somehow I
feel that your father and I have always been on
this boat and that all the rest of it is a dream&mdash;even
my dear children are just dream children.
I believe that is the state of mind that Dr. Wright
wanted your father to attain. I think he has attained
it, too. He worries less and less and will
lie for hours in his deck chair watching the sailors
at work, seemingly with no care in the world.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Tell my dear little Bobby he must be very good
and must mind all his sisters, even Lucy. There
is no scrap of news too small to interest us and
you must tell us what you are doing and all the
doings of your friends. Give our kindest regards
to all the servants and tell them I know they are
taking good care of you in our absence.</p>

<p><span class="sign2">Good by, my darlings,</span><br />

<p class="center">From Gwen to Teacher.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="in2">Greendale, Va.</span><br />
May &mdash;, 19&mdash;.
</p>

<p>My dear Teacher:</p>

<p>At first, I missed the school so much that I
felt as though I could hardly stand to have you
away for four long months. Now I am so busy
that it is growing much easier for me. Even
Josh says he misses you, too, but I think he is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
happy in not having to bathe. I make him say
some lessons to me every day and practice his
penmanship.</p>

<p>Some gentlemen from Richmond, the capital of
the state, situated on the James, are now building
a camp on the land that my father at one
time owned. They have engaged Josh and me
to serve in the capacity of cook and gardener.
I, of course, am the cook. I find I can apply the
knowledge that you have imparted to me at
school, and the young gentlemen are very kind
in praising my culinary efforts. I learned that
word from Mr. Somerville who used it quite often
and then I looked it up in my school dictionary
and now have added it to my vocabulary.</p>

<p>At first, I felt almost faint when I had to go
in the cabin where Father and I used to live, but
it was necessary if I was going to do anything
for these young gentlemen, and now the horror
of the cabin has passed from me. I believe I
would not even mind being there at night, but
Josh says he is afraid of haunts. Of course he
expresses himself as &ldquo;feard er hants.&rdquo; Josh distresses
me because he will not try to speak proper
English. He is so good except for not washing
and saying we uns, etc.</p>

<p>I try not to be critical of my surroundings, remembering
as I ever must, how good Aunt
Mandy and Josh have been to me, because even
before Father died Aunt Mandy was the only
woman I could remember who had ever been
loving to me. I do wish they liked to wash more
than they do, though. I try to keep Aunt Mandy&rsquo;s
cabin clean and she likes it now that she does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
not have to do it herself. I set the table carefully,
too, and she likes the flowers I put in the
centre. I think Aunt Mandy would have been
cultured if she had ever had the chance. She
loves beautiful things like sunsets and distant
mountains.</p>

<p>I think Mr. Somerville and Mr. Bill Tinsley
like beautiful things, too, but they are like Josh
in some respects. I believe Josh would just as
soon have some one see him cry as to come right
out and say he was really admiring a view. These
young gentlemen don&rsquo;t mind saying girls are
pretty, in fact, they are quite frank about saying
they are even beautiful and have long discussions
about which young lady is the most beautiful
of some sisters, the Misses Carter, who are
coming up here to be the mistresses of this camp.
I am very eagerly awaiting their arrival. I am
to be employed regularly by them, so Mr. Somerville
has just informed me, and I am going to
make a great deal of money, enough to enable me
to buy the books I need and have some warm
clothes for next winter and to pay for my schooling.
I appreciate the kindness of the Mission
School in giving me my tuition so far, and now
I am extremely happy that I will be able to pay
something, and that will give the chance to some
other child in the mountains to get an education.
The young ladies are to give me ten dollars a
month for four months. Don&rsquo;t you consider this
a rare opportunity? Josh and Josephus are also
employed by the month.</p>

<p>I am afraid that my letter is composed in a
stilted manner. You remember that is the complaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
you have always made in my compositions,
but I find it impossible to be free and easy in my
writing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="f8">OFF FOR THE MOUNTAINS.</span></h2>


<p>On the train at last and headed for the mountains!</p>

<p>That month of preparation had been about the
busiest in the lives of the Carter girls. Douglas
had graduated at school and taken her examinations
for college, besides being the head and guiding
star of the family. Her father&rsquo;s burden
seemed to have fallen on her young shoulders;
everything was brought to her to decide. Helen
was fully capable of taking the initiative but her
extravagant tendencies were constantly cropping
up, and Douglas was afraid to give her free rein
for fear she would overturn them in a ditch of
debt.</p>

<p>The letter from their mother had been unfortunate
in a measure since it had but strengthened
Helen&rsquo;s ideas on what was suitable in the way of
clothes. She wanted to plunge into the extravagance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of outing suits and pig-skin shoes and all
kinds of extremely attractive camping get-ups
advertised in New York papers. Douglas was
firm, however, and Helen was forced to content
herself with a love of a corduroy skirt, cold gravy
in color, with sport pockets and smoked pearl
buttons. Lucy had pouted a whole day because
she could not have one, too, just like it.</p>

<p>Nan was a great comfort to Douglas as she
was fully sensible of the importance of their not
charging anything, no matter how small, so that
when their father did recover he would not have
debts awaiting him. The only trouble about Nan
was she was so often in a dream, and her memory
was not to be depended upon. With all the good
intentions in the world she would forget to deliver
a most important message, or would promise and
mean to attend to something and then lose herself
in a book of poetry and forget it absolutely.</p>

<p>Lucy was gay and bright and very useful when
it came to running errands. Her only trouble
was the constant sparring with Helen, whom she
secretly admired more than any one in the world.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Bobby had spent a blissful month of
&ldquo;shoving&rdquo; for Dr. Wright. Dr. Wright had a
theory that all children were naturally good and
that when they were seemingly naughty it was
only because they were not sufficiently occupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give the smallest child some real responsibility
and he is sure to be worthy of it. If their
brains and hands and feet are busy with something
that they feel is worth while, children are
sure to be happy.&rdquo; Bobby had sat in his car a
half hour at a time, while the doctor was busy
with patients, perfectly happy and good, contenting
himself with playing chauffeur. He would
occasionally toot the horn just to let the passer-by
understand that he was on the job.</p>

<p>The beloved home had been put in apple pie
order and handed over to the poor, rich fugitives
from the war zone. The kind old cook had bidden
them a tearful farewell and betaken herself
to her new place after careful admonishings of
her pupil, Helen, not to let nobody &rsquo;suade her
that any new fangled yeast is so good as tater
yeast.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The real fun in the venture was buying the
provisions and necessary camping outfits. That
was money that must be spent and they could do
it with a clear conscience. The lists were written
and rewritten and revised a score of times until
they could not think of a single thing that had
been left out. The freight was sent off several
days ahead of them to give poor Cousin Lizzie&rsquo;s
bed time to get there before them.</p>

<p>Poor Cousin Lizzie, indeed! She was brave
about the undertaking up to the time of starting,
but when she was handed into the common coach,
there being no parlor car on that morning train,
she almost gave up. Nothing but the memory of
old Cousin Robert Carter&rsquo;s kindness to her
mother sustained her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children&rsquo;s
children,&rdquo; she muttered as she sank on the
dusty, dingy cushions of the very common, common
day coach. &ldquo;That is surely what old Cousin
Robert Carter did. I have not ridden in such a
coach for more than thirty years, I am sure.
Why was this train chosen? There must be good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
trains running to the mountains that have chair
cars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cousin Lizzie,&rdquo; said Douglas, &ldquo;but you
see Greendale is a very small station and only the
very accommodating accommodations stop there.
The trains with chair cars stop only at the big
places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas was very tired and looked it. She
was very pale and her firm mouth would tremble
a little in spite of her self-control. No one seemed
to notice it, as every one was tired and every one
had been busy. She felt when they were once
off that she could rest, if only Cousin Lizzie would
not complain too much and if Helen and Lucy
would not squabble and if dear little Bobby would
not poke his head too far out of the window.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright came down to see them off and as
he shook hands with Douglas, he looked very
searchingly at her tired face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be selfish when you get to the mountains
and rest for a week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are
about all in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be all right in a few minutes. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
just getting started that has tired me. Bobby,
please don&rsquo;t poke your head out,&mdash;your arm,
either. Don&rsquo;t you know something might come
along and chop you right in two?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shover for this here train. If I don&rsquo;t
stick my arm way out the train a-runnin&rsquo; up behind
us will c&rsquo;lision with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, young man, you are still in my employ
and I don&rsquo;t intend to have you working for
the C.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;O. while you are working for me. When
my chauffeur travels to the mountains, he has to
keep his hands inside the windows and his head,
too. He must be kind to his sisters, especially
his Sister Douglas, who is very tired. I am really
letting you off duty so you can take care of
Douglas. You see, when a lot of women start
on a trip they have to have some man with them
to look after them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, boss, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be that man.
Women folks is meant to look after eatin&rsquo;s an&rsquo;
to sew up holes an&rsquo; things. I&rsquo;m hungry right
now!&rdquo; exclaimed Bobby, man-like, finding some
work immediately for the down-trodden sex.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; called the brakeman.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright was bidding hasty adieux when it
was discovered that Nan had left the carefully
prepared lunch basket in the waiting-room. Poor
Nan! She had been occupied trying to remember
some lines of Alfred Noyes about a railroad station
and had carelessly placed the basket on the
seat beside her, and then, in the excitement of
getting Oscar and Susan into the colored coach
and picking up all the many little parcels
and shawls and small pillows that Cousin
Lizzie always traveled with, she had forgotten
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me get off and get it,&rdquo; she implored,
but Dr. Wright gently pushed her back into her
seat and hastily whispered something to her that
made her smile instead of cry, which she was on
the verge of doing. She sat quite quietly while
the engine puffed its way out of the shed and
Dr. Wright jumped off the moving train.</p>

<p>She waved to him and he gave her a reassuring
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is like the hills,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;&lsquo;I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
look unto the hills from whence cometh my
help.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan, how could you?&rdquo; started Helen, and
Lucy chimed in with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, how could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry, but maybe it will come all right,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come all right, anyhow!&rdquo; sniffed Cousin
Lizzie. &ldquo;It is all right now as far as I am concerned.
I certainly could not taste a mouthful
in such surroundings as these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas put her tired head on the dingy, dusty
red plush upholstery and closed her eyes. Food
made no difference to her. All she wanted was
rest. Bobby opened the package of chewing gum
that his employer had slipped him as advance
wages, and forgot all about the hunger that he
had declared a moment before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a keering, Nan, &rsquo;bout no lunch. I am
goin&rsquo; to buy all the choclid an&rsquo; peanuts what the
man brings in the train an&rsquo; old lunch ain&rsquo;t no
good nohow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan kept on smiling an enigmatic smile that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
mystified Helen and Lucy. They were accustomed
to Nan&rsquo;s forgetting things but she was
usually so contrite and miserable. Now she just
smiled and peeped out the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she gives a hang,&rdquo; whispered
Lucy to Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks that way. If she had spent hours making
the sandwiches, as I did, maybe she would
not be so calm about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made some of them, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, so you did,&mdash;about three, I should
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots more. You&rsquo;re all the time thinking you
make all the sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas opened her tired eyes at the sharp tone
of voice that Lucy had fallen into.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls, please don&rsquo;t squabble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, we won&rsquo;t! You go to sleep, honey,
and I&rsquo;ll keep Bobby from falling out the window
and agree with Lucy about everything even if
she insists that Dr. Wright is an Adonis. Come
here, Bobby. Helen is going to make up a really
true story to tell you,&rdquo; and Helen lifted her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
brother from the seat by Douglas. In a few
moments he was so absorbed in the wonderful
true story about bears and whales that a little
boy named Bobby had shot and caught, he did
not notice that the train had stopped at the first
station after leaving Richmond.</p>

<p>Some excitement on the platform made them
all look out the window. The conductor had
waved to the engineer his signal for starting when
a car came dashing madly up to the station.
Frantic pulling of ropes by the accommodating
conductor on the accommodating accommodation!
A belated traveler, no doubt!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my &rsquo;ployer!&rdquo; screamed Bobby. &ldquo;Look at
him park his car! Ain&rsquo;t he some driver, though?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Dr. Wright, breaking laws as to speed,
presuming on the Red Cross tag that the doctors
attach to their cars. Several policemen had noted
him as he sped through the suburbs, but felt
surely it was a matter of life and death when
they saw the Red Cross tag, and let him go unmolested
and unfined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is, Miss Nan!&rdquo; he called as he waved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the heavy basket, endangering the precious sandwiches.
Eager hands drew the basket through
an open window while a grinning brakeman and
a rather irate conductor got the train started
once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some aromatic ammonia! Make Miss
Douglas take a teaspoonful in a glass of water,&rdquo;
he said to Helen as he handed a small vial to
her over Bobby&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;It almost made me miss
the train, but she must have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dr. Wright, I am so much obliged to
you. You are very kind to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen&rsquo;s been making up a wonderfulest true
story for me,&rdquo; called Bobby, leaning out dangerously
far to see the last of his &rsquo;ployer. &ldquo;So
I&rsquo;m being good an&rsquo; not worrying Douglas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was unalloyed approval now in the blue,
blue eyes, and Helen thought, as the young doctor
gave one of his rare smiles, that he was really
almost handsome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="f8">THE CAMP.</span></h2>


<p>The lunch did not go begging. Even Cousin
Lizzie forgot her disgusting surroundings and
deigned to partake of Helen&rsquo;s very good lettuce
sandwiches. She even pronounced the coffee from
the thermos bottle about the best she had tasted
for many a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cook doesn&rsquo;t make very good coffee. I
don&rsquo;t know what she does to it. When we go
back to Richmond I think I shall get you to show
her how you make it, Helen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen smiled and had not the heart to tell her
cousin that her own cook had made the coffee,
after all. Of all the young Carters, Miss Somerville
was fondest of Helen. She had infinite patience
with her foibles and thought her regard
for dress and style just as it should be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s appearance is a very important
factor and too much thought cannot be given it,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
she would say. Miss Somerville had boasted
much beauty in her youth and still was a very
handsome old lady, with a quantity of silver white
hair and the complexion of a débutante. &ldquo;Gentlemen
are more attracted by becoming clothes
than anything else,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and of course
it is nothing but hypocrisy that makes women
say they do not wish to attract the opposite sex.&rdquo;
Miss Somerville, having had many opportunities
to marry, and having chosen single blessedness
of her own free will, always spoke with great
authority of the male sex. She always called
them gentlemen, however, and the way she said
&ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; made you think of dignified persons
in long-tailed coats and high stocks who paid
their addresses on bended knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one more station before we get to Greendale!&rdquo;
exclaimed Douglas. &ldquo;I feel real rested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cause I&rsquo;se been so good,&rdquo; said the angel
Bobby. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a single time had my head an&rsquo;
arm chopped off. I tell you, I don&rsquo;t do shover&rsquo;s
work for the C.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;O. for nothin&rsquo;. My boss don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;low me to work for nobody but jest him.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been as good as gold,&rdquo; said Douglas,
&ldquo;and now I am going to buy you some candy,&rdquo;
she added, as the train boy came through crying
his wares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choclid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you have marshmallows instead.
They are so much less evident on your countenance,&rdquo;
suggested Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! I&rsquo;d jest as soon &rsquo;cause that
nice dirty boy in the mountings kin milk me
some choclid out&rsquo;n the cow whenever I gits
hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a filthy trip it has been!&rdquo; said Cousin
Lizzie as she shook the cinders from her black
taffeta suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is grimy,&rdquo; declared Helen, &ldquo;and I came
off without my Dorine. I had just got a new
one. I do hate to arrive anywhere with a shiny
nose. Lend me your vanity box, Douglas,
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanity box! I never thought about bringing
it. It is packed with the other extra, useless
things in Cousin Lizzie&rsquo;s trunk room. It never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
entered my head that we would want a vanity
box at a mountain camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t intend to have a shiny nose in
a mountain camp any more than any other place.
I hate to look greasy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a marshmallow,&rdquo; drawled Nan. &ldquo;They
are great beautifiers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Helen powdered her nose with some of
Bobby&rsquo;s candy, much to the amusement of that
infant.</p>

<p>Lewis and Bill were waiting for the travelers
at the station at Greendale with the ramshackle
little car, which they had christened the Mountain
Goat because of its hill climbing proclivities.
Josh was also there, with the faithful Josephus
hitched to an old cart to carry the luggage up to
the camp.</p>

<p>The porter from the summer hotel of Greendale
was on the platform as the train stopped
and he immediately came forward, thinking these
stylish passengers were for his hostelry; but the
little mountain boy stepped in front of him and
said:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns is you allses baggage man,&rdquo; and he
seized their grips and parcels and won their
hearts as well with his merry blue eyes and soft
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must be the dirty boy what&rsquo;s got a
choclid cow!&rdquo; exclaimed Bobby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dirty
boy, too, now I&rsquo;m come to live in the mountings
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be a baggage man, too, if Dr.
Wright will let me off from being a shover up
here where th&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no traffic cops to &rsquo;rest you
if&rsquo;n you don&rsquo;t stick out yo&rsquo; arm goin&rsquo; round the
cornders. I&rsquo;d most ruther be a baggage man
than a shover if&rsquo;n I can sit in front with you and
drive the mule.&rdquo; All this poured forth in one
breath while the young men were greeting the
ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; shouted the brakeman and the
signal was given for the engineer to start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, where are Oscar and Susan?&rdquo; from a distracted
Douglas. &ldquo;Stop, please stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar was discovered peacefully sleeping and
Susan so deep in her beloved dream book that she
was oblivious to the passing of time and miles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
They were dragged from the colored coach by
the amused brakeman and dumped on the platform
as the train made its second rumbling start
upgrade.</p>

<p>The bringing of these two servants had been a
problem to our girls. They were both of them
kind and faithful but were strictly urban in their
raising, and how the real rough country would
affect them remained to be seen. They sniffed
scornfully at the small station with its stuffy
waiting-rooms, one for coloreds and one, whites,
and looked at the great mountains that closed
them in with distrust and scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Oscar, this place jes&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no place at
all,&rdquo; grumbled Susan. &ldquo;Look at that shack over
yonder what passes fer a sto&rsquo;, and this here little
po&rsquo; white boy settin&rsquo; up yonder on the seat with
our Bobby! He needn&rsquo;t think he is goin&rsquo; ter
&rsquo;sociate with the quality. You, Bobby, git down
from thar an&rsquo; come hol&rsquo; my han&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hol&rsquo; your grandmother&rsquo;s han&rsquo;! I ain&rsquo;t no
baby. I&rsquo;m a &rsquo;spressman an&rsquo; am a gointer hol&rsquo; the
mule. That was pretty near a joke,&rdquo; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
looking confidingly into the eyes of his new
friend. &ldquo;One reason I was so good a-comin&rsquo; up
here was because we let Susan go in the Jim Crow
coach to keep Uncle Oscar comp&rsquo;ny, &rsquo;cause when
she is ridin&rsquo; anywhere near me she&rsquo;s all time
wantin&rsquo; me to hol&rsquo; her han.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d make two loads of you,&rdquo;
said Lewis, when the greetings were over. &ldquo;Bill
can go ahead with Aunt Lizzie and some of you
while the rest of us walk, and when he puts you
out at the camp he can come back and meet us
half way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas must ride,&rdquo; declared Helen. &ldquo;She is
so tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lot rested now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure, you must ride,&rdquo; said Lewis, a shade
of disappointment in his tone as he had been
rather counting on having a nice little walk and
talk with his favorite cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Lewis, you run the jitney first. Legs
stiff and tired sitting still,&rdquo; said Bill magnanimously.</p>

<p>So while Lewis was cheated out of a walk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Douglas, he had the satisfaction of having her
sit beside him as he drove the rickety car up the
winding mountain road. Miss Somerville was
packed in the back with Nan and Lucy, but when
Lucy found that Helen was to walk, she decided
to walk, too. Susan was put in her place, and
so her feelings were somewhat mollified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josephus ain&rsquo;t above totin&rsquo; one of the niggers
&rsquo;long with the trunks,&rdquo; said Josh, determined to
get even for the remarks he had heard Oscar and
Susan make in regard to &ldquo;po&rsquo; white trash.&rdquo; The
antagonism that exists between the mountaineer
and darkey is hard to overcome.</p>

<p>So Oscar, the proud butler of &ldquo;nothin&rsquo; but fust
famblies,&rdquo; was forced either to walk up the mountain,
something he dreaded, or climb up on the
seat of the cart by the despised &ldquo;po&rsquo; white trash.&rdquo;
He determined on the latter course and took his
seat in dignified silence with the expression
of one who says: &ldquo;My head is bloody but
unbowed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The freight came and we have hauled it up
and unpacked the best we could. I am afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
it is going to be mighty rough for you girls and
for poor Aunt Lizzie, who is certainly a brick
for coming, but we have done our best,&rdquo; said
Lewis to Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rough, indeed! Who would expect divans
and Turkish rugs at a camp? We are sure to
like it and we are so grateful to you and Mr.
Tinsley. But look at the view! Oh, Cousin
Lizzie, just look at the view!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see here, Douglas, I said I would come
and chaperone Cousin Robert Carter&rsquo;s granddaughters
if no one would make me look at views.
Views do not appeal to me.&rdquo; She couldn&rsquo;t help
looking at the view, though, as there was nothing
else to look at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; lak you, Miss Lizzie. I don&rsquo; think a
thing er views. I ain&rsquo;t never seed one befo&rsquo; but
I heard tell of &rsquo;em. Looks lak a view ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;
but jes&rsquo; seem&rsquo; fur, an&rsquo; if&rsquo;n th&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; ter see,
what&rsquo;s the use in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s lines came to Nan and she whispered
them to herself as she looked off across the
wonderful valley:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;&lsquo;The world is too much with us; late and soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little we see in Nature that is ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sea that bares her bosom to the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds that will be howling at all hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this, for everything, we are out of tune;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It moves us not. Great God! I&rsquo;d rather be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pagan suckled in a creed outworn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>She intended to whisper it to herself but as
the march of the lines took possession of her, she
spoke them out loud without knowing it. On
the ninth line she came out strong with, &ldquo;&lsquo;Great
God! I&rsquo;d rather be&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; Miss Somerville and
Susan looked at her in amazement. Her dark
eyes were fixed on the despised view with a look
of a somnambulist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lawd a mussy! Miss Nan done got a tech er
heat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blow your horn, Lewis. Didn&rsquo;t you hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Nan?&rdquo; from Miss Somerville. &ldquo;She must see
something coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan went off into such a peal of laughter that
Bill Tinsley himself could not have vied with her.
She blushingly admitted it was just some poetry
she was repeating to herself, which made Miss
Somerville agree with Susan that Miss Nan had
a &ldquo;tech er heat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better have a dose of that aromatic
ammonia and lie down for a while when we get
to the top,&rdquo; suggested Miss Lizzie dryly.</p>

<p>The road stopped at the cabin some distance
from the pavilion, so they alighted and Lewis
turned the car on a seemingly impossible place
and careened down the mountain to pick up the
others before they were exhausted with the climb.</p>

<p>The cabin was in perfect order and so clean
that even Miss Lizzie was destined to find it difficult
to discover germs. Gwen had rubbed and
scrubbed and then beautified to the best of her
ability. She had purchased a few yards of coarse
scrim at the store and fresh curtains were at the
windows. The white iron bed was made up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
spotless counterpane and pillows, and on the
freshly scrubbed pine floor was a new rag rug
of her own weave. The open fireplace was filled
with fragrant spruce boughs, and on the high
mantel and little deal table she had put cans of
honeysuckle and Cherokee roses. She had longed
for some vases but had not liked to ask the young
men to buy them. She felt that the curtains were
all the expense she should plunge them into.</p>

<p>When Gwen had seen the car approaching she
had shyly gone behind the cabin. She dreaded
in a measure meeting these girls and their cousin.
She had become accustomed to the presence of
the young gentlemen, but what would the girls
think of her? Wouldn&rsquo;t they think she was odd
and funny looking? She was quite aware of the
fact that she was very different in appearance
from the girls in cities. She had pored over too
many illustrated papers not to know how other
girls her age dressed and looked. Her scant blue
dress was made after a pattern sent to the Mission
School by some interested ladies. It was
supposed to be the best pattern for children to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
use where the cloth must be economically cut. So
it was and singularly picturesque in its straight
lines, but Gwen was but human and now that
fashion sheets plainly said wider skirts and flaring,
here she was in her narrow little dress! She
hated it. Bare legs and feet, too!</p>

<p>Her instinct was to turn and flee around the
mountain to the arms of Aunt Mandy, who
thought she was the most wonderful little girl
in all the world. But there was the kind of fighting
blood in her that could not run. The spirit of
a grandfather who had been one of the heroes
of Balaclava made her hold up her proud little
head and go boldly around to the front of the
cabin to face the dreadful ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must be Gwen!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas,
coming forward with both hands to greet the
girl. &ldquo;Mr. Somerville has told us how splendidly
you have taken care of them and I know you
must have arranged this room for Cousin Lizzie.
It is lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gwen no longer felt like one of the Light Brigade.
This was not the jaws of Death and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
mouth of Hell. This sweet young lady didn&rsquo;t
even notice her bare feet, and the scanty skirt
made no difference at all. She introduced her
to Miss Somerville and to her sister, Nan, who
was also graciousness itself. Miss Somerville
was a little stiff, reminding Gwen of the old ladies
on the hotel piazza who bought the lace and
tatting that she and Aunt Mandy made on the
long winter evenings when the sun went down
behind the mountains so early.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the room will do very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather faint praise and took very little
time to say when one considered that Gwen had
spent days on her task. But Nan and Douglas
made up to her for their cousin&rsquo;s seeming coldness
by going into raptures over the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lewis did not tell us he was going to whitewash
the room for Cousin Lizzie,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I whitewashed it myself. The young gentlemen
were so occupied with constructing the pavilion
that I could not bear to interrupt them.&rdquo;
Nan and Douglas could not help smiling at the
little English girl&rsquo;s stilted language but they hid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
their amusement. &ldquo;I prepared the attic room for
the negro maid. Would you like to go up and
see that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! Come on, Susan, and see your
room. It is to be right up over Cousin Lizzie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, praise be to my Maker that I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to have to sleep in the air. My lungs is weak at
best an&rsquo; no doubt the air would be the death of
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan&rsquo;s figure belied her words, as she was
an exceedingly buxom girl with a chest expansion
that Sandow might have envied her.</p>

<p>The attic was entered by a trap door from the
room below and in lieu of stairs there was nothing
but a ladder made chicken-steps style: small cross
pieces nailed on a board.</p>

<p>The attic room was scrubbed as clean as Miss
Lizzie&rsquo;s. The low ceiling and very small windows
certainly suited Susan&rsquo;s idea of sanitation,
as very little air could find its way into the chamber.
A rough wooden bed was built against the
wall, as is often the way in mountain cabins,
more like a low, deep shelf than a bed. Gwen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
had stuffed a new tick with nice clean straw and
Susan bid fair to have pleasant dreams on her
fresh bed. A night spent without dreams of some
kind was one wasted in the eyes of the colored
girl who consulted her dream book constantly.</p>

<p>Josh had railed at Gwen for putting a bunch
of black-eyed Susans in the attic room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waitin&rsquo; on a nigger! Humph! You uns
ain&rsquo;t called on to lower yo&rsquo;sef that a way. Niggers
is niggers an&rsquo; we uns would ruther to bust
than fetch an&rsquo; carry fer &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This seems a very small thing to do,&rdquo; Gwen
had answered. She did not share the mountaineer&rsquo;s
prejudice against the black race. &ldquo;I
have no doubt this girl will like flowers just as
much as Miss Somerville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she did and a great deal more, as she expressed
her appreciation of the tomato can of
posies, and Miss Somerville had not even noticed
the bouquets in her room. As Susan followed the
girls up the funny steps and her head emerged
through the trap door, her eyes immediately fell
on the flowers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Gawd be praised! My dream is out!
I done fell asleep in the cyars an&rsquo; dream I see
little chillun picking flowers in a fiel&rsquo;. My book
say that is one er two interpretations: you is
either goin&rsquo; ter have fresh flowers laid on yer
grabe er some one is goin&rsquo; ter make you a prisint
er flowers. I thank yer, little miss, fer the
bowkay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you are welcome,&rdquo; and Gwen gave her
a grave smile.</p>

<p>Susan had been quite doubtful at first what her
attitude should be with this white girl who went
barefooted and whitewashed cabins herself. She
knew very well how to treat po&rsquo; white trash: like
the dust under her feet. There was no other way
for a self-respecting colored girl to treat them.
But this white girl was different, somehow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She got a high steppin&rsquo; way that is mo&rsquo; like
quality,&rdquo; she declared to Oscar later. &ldquo;She calls
that slab-sided, shanty-boat &rsquo;ooman Aunt Mandy,
but I &rsquo;low they ain&rsquo;t no kin. Now that there Josh
is low flung. I think Miss Douglas is crazy to
let Bobby run around with him as much as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
do. I bet his maw would stop it fast enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Carter girls&rsquo; enthusiasm and praise for the
camp fully repaid the young men for their untiring
labor. The pavilion was really a thing of
beauty, built right up in the trees, as it were, like
a great nest. It had no walls, but the roof projected
far enough to keep out anything short of
horizontal rain. An artistic rustic seat encircled
the great poplar trunk in the centre and rough
benches were built around three sides of the hall.
Stairs went down on the fourth side to the
kitchen in the basement, and outside, steps gave
entrance to the pavilion. The whole building was
screened. This was to be dining-room, living-room,
dance hall and everything and anything
they chose to make of it. The girls had reserved
their victrola in renting the house and
it now had the place of honor near the circular
seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just unpacked it this morning,&rdquo; said
Lewis. &ldquo;There was no use in music with no girls
to dance with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t men strange creatures?&rdquo; laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Helen. &ldquo;Now girls love to dance so, they dance
with each other, but two men would just as soon
do fancy work as dance with one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sooner,&rdquo; muttered Bill. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a spin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So a spirited &ldquo;one-step&rdquo; was put on and then
the youths felt themselves to be overpaid for their
work as they danced over the floor that had been
the cause of many an aching joint and mashed
thumb. Joints were not aching now and mashed
thumbs were miraculously cured by clasping the
hands of these pretty girls.</p>

<p>That first supper in the mountains was a very
merry one. Miss Elizabeth was much refreshed
by a nap and came to the pavilion quite resigned
to life. She had nothing but praise for the handiwork
of her beloved nephew, and even included
the laconic Bill in her compliments. She wished,
however, he would not be so sudden in his laughter
as she was afraid it betrayed the vacant
mind.</p>

<p>Gwen had made a delicious fricassee of chicken
in the fireless cooker, the mysteries of which she
had been taught at the mission school. Hot biscuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and honey from Aunt Mandy&rsquo;s hive completed
the feast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What delicious biscuit!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Gwen a wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse me, Miss Douglas, but I made them
biscuit,&rdquo; said Susan, who was waiting on the
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Susan, I thought you said you couldn&rsquo;t
cook a thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was in Richmond. I ain&rsquo;t boun&rsquo; by no
regulations of no club whin I leaves the city.
You see in my club, which is called the Loyal
Housemaids, we swars never to &rsquo;tend to two
&rsquo;fessions at onct. When we is housemaids, we
is housemaids, but out here where th&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t ter say
no house, I kin do as I&rsquo;s a mind, and I sho&rsquo; did
want ter make some biscuit ter go with that there
fricassy. Uncle Oscar an&rsquo; I is goin&rsquo; ter share the
cookin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; Miss Gwen is goin&rsquo; ter do the haid
wuck. We ain&rsquo;t conversant with the fi&rsquo;less
cooker an&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;tall &rsquo;bout lightin&rsquo;
kerosene stoves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our girls were much gratified by Susan&rsquo;s willingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to turn in and be of some real assistance.
The work when only the family were there would
be light, but if the many week-enders who had
announced their intention of coming to their
camp materialized, they well knew that it would
take the combined efforts of them all to feed the
hungry hordes and to wash the many dishes and
make up the many cots. The laundering of the
bed linen and towels would amount to more than
they could cope with, so they had decided to
patronize a laundry in Charlottesville, for all the
flat work.</p>

<p>Bobby was in a state of extreme bliss. He had
been allowed to help Josh feed Josephus and now
he was permitted to come to supper without doing
more towards purifying himself than just
&ldquo;renching the Germans&rdquo; off his hands and face.
He was to sleep in the tent with his Cousin
Lewis, too.</p>

<p>The girls&rsquo; tent was pitched just behind the Englishman&rsquo;s
cabin, while the masculine quarters
were nearer the pavilion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will put up other tents as we need them,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
said Lewis. &ldquo;We have chopped down enough
trees and cleared enough ground to camp the
whole of Richmond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, our boarders won&rsquo;t come for
a week yet and we can have time to enjoy ourselves
for a while,&rdquo; sighed Douglas.</p>

<p>She was very tired but it was not the miserable
fatigue she had felt in town. It was a good
healthy tired that meant a night&rsquo;s rest with nothing
to think about but how good life was and how
kind people were. Everything was certainly
working out well. Cousin Lizzie was behaving
in a wonderful way for an old lady who thought
much of her ease and had no love of Nature.
Helen and Lucy were too interested to squabble
at all and so were getting on splendidly. Bobby
was behaving himself beautifully, and even the
servants were rising to the occasion and evidently
intending to do their best. The only fly in the
ointment was their attitude towards Josh and his
towards them. He openly called them &ldquo;niggers,&rdquo;
and they called him &ldquo;po&rsquo; white&rdquo; right to his face.
Gwen, they seemed to have accepted at her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
value and not judged by her bare feet and scanty
frock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Niggers, an&rsquo; min&rsquo; you, Miss Douglas, we don&rsquo;t
&rsquo;low nobody but us to call us out of our names
that way,&rdquo; said Oscar. &ldquo;Niggers is reg&rsquo;lar bloodhoun&rsquo;s
an&rsquo; they kin smell out quality same as
geologists kin. Me&rsquo;n Susan knows that that there
little Miss Gwen is a lady bawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe she is, Oscar, and I hope you and
Susan will be just as nice to her as you can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best, but land&rsquo;s sake, Miss Douglas,
don&rsquo; arsk us to be gentle with that there Josh.
He is low flung and mischeevous to that extent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Oscar,&rdquo; laughed Douglas, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t
be too hard on him.&rdquo; Lewis had told her that
Josh was fully capable of taking care of himself
and in the trial of wits Josh would certainly
come out ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He already done scart Susan to death, tellin&rsquo;
her about hants in the mountings. He says that
Miss Gwen&rsquo;s paw was pestered by a ringin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
buzzin&rsquo; in his haid that drove him &rsquo;stracted, and
he used to roam the mountings trying to git shet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the sound, til bynby he couldn&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; it no mo
an&rsquo; up&rsquo;n jumped off&rsquo;n a place called the Devil&rsquo;s
Gorge and brack ev&rsquo;y bone in his body. An&rsquo; he
sayed the Englishman still hants these here parts
an&rsquo; you can hear the buzzin&rsquo; an&rsquo; ringin&rsquo; sometimes
jes&rsquo; as plain as the po&rsquo; man uster hear it in
his life time. He say he won&rsquo;t come over here
arfter nightfall to save yo neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; declared Douglas. &ldquo;Well,
all the buzzing on earth won&rsquo;t keep me awake,&rdquo;
but before she went to sleep, she recounted the
ridiculous tale to her three sisters, who shared
the tent with her.</p>

<p>They agreed that they would have to ask Lewis
to speak to Josh about telling such things to poor
Susan, who was already eaten up with superstition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it grand to sleep in a&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; but Lucy
was asleep before she said what it was grand to
sleep in. Nan tried to recall some lines of
Wordsworth that Gwen reminded her of, but
&ldquo;The sweetest thing that ever grew,&rdquo; was all she
could think of before sleep got her, too. Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
forgot to put olive oil on her eyebrows, a darkening
process she was much interested in, and
went off into happy, dreamless slumber. Douglas
shut her tired eyes and sleep claimed her for
its own before she could count ten.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="f8">HANTS.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; The call was followed by a
blood-curdling shriek that drowned the noise of
tree frogs and whip-poor-wills.</p>

<p>Douglas and Nan both awoke with a start and
Helen stirred in her sleep. Lewis, over at the
men&rsquo;s tent, made a mental note that he must go
out with a gun early in the morning and try to
shoot that screech owl. Bill, whose passion next
to soldiering was base ball, muttered an unintelligible
something about: &ldquo;Ball two! Strike
one! Rotten umpire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar heard it, and remembering the terrible
tales Josh had been telling, drew his blanket up
close over his wool. &ldquo;Walls don&rsquo;t keep hants out
no better&rsquo;n canvas, but all the same I&rsquo;d like to
know they was somethin&rsquo; more substantiated
around this nigger than jist a dog tent. I&rsquo;s gonter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
git some cotton to stuff in my years &rsquo;ginst anudder
night,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; again rang out. &ldquo;The debble
is got me! Gawd in Hebben help me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan!&rdquo; gasped the three older girls. They
were out of their cots and into kimonos by the
help of a flash light Helen had under her pillow,
before the call came again. The three-quarter
moon had set but the stars gave light enough
for them to see the two young men in full
tilt, coming to their assistance, rifles in hand
and striped bath gowns flapping around bare
legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! My sweet Gawd, help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Somerville had more fear of germs than
anything else, so slept with her door wide open.
Being a very thorough person in anything she
undertook whether it was solitaire, knitting
scarves, chaperoning or sleeping, Miss Somerville
was now sleeping with all her might. She had
pitched her&mdash;what would be called a snore in a
plebeian person, but we will call it her breathing,&mdash;she
had pitched her breathing in harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the tree frogs and katydids and was now hitting
off a very pretty tune.</p>

<p>Up the chicken steps the young folks trooped,
Lewis in front with the flash light, Miss Somerville
still sleeping the sleep of the virtuous and
just. Poor Susan was lying on her shelf-like bed,
her head covered up, having emerged only for
yelling purposes and then quickly covering herself
again. Her great feet were sticking out at
the bottom and on them were perched three large
hornets, stinging at their ease. A kerosene lamp,
turned down too low and smelling at an unseemly
rate, was on the box that served as a table. The
windows were tightly closed because of her weak
lungs and the air could almost have been cut
with its combination of odors, cheap-scented soap,
musk and just plain Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan, Susan! What is the matter?&rdquo; demanded
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, little Mistis! That English hant has got
me by the toe. I was expecting him after what
that there po&rsquo; white boy done tol&rsquo; me, but I
thought maybe he would be held off by Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Lizzie Somerville. Hants ain&rsquo;t likely to worry
the quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Susan, nothing has you by the toe,&rdquo;
said Helen sternly. &ldquo;You must have had nightmare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But look at the hornets!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan.
&ldquo;Why, the room is full of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then such an opening of windows and tumbling
down that trap door as ensued! Susan had
bounced out of bed to join them, regardless of
the young men, but since she was enveloped in a
high-necked, very thick pink outing flannel gown
she was really more clothed than any of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d fight &rsquo;em if I had on more clothes,&rdquo; declared
Bill, as he landed on the floor below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ouch! One got me on the shin then,&rdquo; from
Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s down my neck!&rdquo; squealed Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut the trap door so they won&rsquo;t disturb
Cousin Lizzie,&rdquo; commanded Douglas.</p>

<p>They got out of doors without Miss Somerville&rsquo;s
even dropping a stitch from the raveled
sleeve of care she was so industriously knitting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
&ldquo;You could almost two-step to it,&rdquo; drawled Nan,
nursing a stung finger.</p>

<p>Bill went off into one of his uncontrollable
bursts of laughter and the peaceful sleeper
stirred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shh! Bill, you must dry up,&rdquo; warned Lewis.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get out another cot and Susan can finish the
night in Aunt Lizzie&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Lewis, please don&rsquo;t make me go back
in yonder. The debble will git me sho next time.
I&rsquo;s safter out under the ferment of the stars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come into our tent, Susan,&rdquo; said
Helen kindly. &ldquo;We are not going to have you
scared to death.&rdquo; So the extra cot was brought
and room was made for the poor, trembling vision
in pink outing flannel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us what it was that got you scared,&rdquo;
asked Nan when they had once more settled themselves
and the young men had gone back to their
quarters, much relieved at the way things had
turned out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that there low-flung Josh was tellin&rsquo; me
&rsquo;bout a English hant what had suffered with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
buzzin&rsquo; an&rsquo; roarin&rsquo; in his haid ter that extent
he done los&rsquo; his reason an&rsquo; one dark night he
up&rsquo;n kilt hissef. An&rsquo; they do say that the po&rsquo;
man still ain&rsquo;t got no rest from the buzzin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
he hants these parts, and sometimes them what
is &lsquo;dicted ter hants kin hear de buzzin&rsquo; and roarin&rsquo;,
&rsquo;cause even though the hant is laid the buzzin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; roarin&rsquo; roams the mountings lak a lost soul.
Whin I gits in the baid, I was plum tuckered
out so I didn&rsquo; wase no time but was soon sleepin&rsquo;
the sleep that falls alike on the jest an&rsquo; the onjest.
I wuck up with a smotherin&rsquo; feelin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would, with not a bit of
air in your room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wuck up, as I say, kinder smotherin&rsquo; like
an&rsquo; then I hears the English hant as plain as day.
Bzzzz! Bzzzz! Brrrr! Brrrr! &lsquo;My Gawd,&rsquo; says I,
&lsquo;pertect me.&rsquo; I tun over in the baid an&rsquo; then the
buzzin&rsquo; sounded lak the rushin&rsquo; of mighty water.
&lsquo;Mebbe he will pass on by me an&rsquo; go to Uncle
Oscar,&rsquo; thinks I. &lsquo;He was the one what scoffed
at Josh&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; of the tale.&rsquo; I kivered my haid
an&rsquo; then that hant got me by the toe.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Susan,&rdquo; laughed Douglas, &ldquo;of course
you know it was a hornet that had you by the
toe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mought think it, Miss Douglas, but hants
is powerful slick the way they kin change theysefs
ter natural things. That debble jes&rsquo; changed
ter hornesses ter mysterfy all of you white folks.
He was a debble hant up ter the physological moment
all of you appeared. I knows lots about
hants from my books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know a lot about hornets from experience,&rdquo;
said Helen, trying to reach the stung
place between her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; drawled Nan. &ldquo;My finger is twice
its natural size.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s all of us go to sleep now,&rdquo; said
Douglas. &ldquo;You are not afraid in here, are you,
Susan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and the girl was off asleep in less
time than it had taken her to arouse most of the
campers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; whispered Douglas, &ldquo;I am afraid
Josh is responsible for the hornets. It sounds as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
though he had prepared his way to scare Susan
by telling the ghost story first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is so. We will have to see to
that youngster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Lewis can handle him. I&rsquo;ll ask
him in the morning. In the meantime, I
will tell Susan not to mention the &lsquo;hants&rsquo; and
maybe Josh will give himself away with curiosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a hard task her young mistresses had
set Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;tall ter hants if you cyarn&rsquo;t
tell about &rsquo;em,&rdquo; she grumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, just wait a day, Susan, and then you
can tell all you&rsquo;ve a mind to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At breakfast that morning Miss Somerville
complained that her rest had been very much
broken but that she had slept much better than
she had ever expected to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am at best a light sleeper,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;The smallest thing disturbs me. Now I distinctly
heard Mr. Tinsley laugh, although he must
have been in his own tent.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>This was too much for poor Bill, who went off
into one of his specialties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ruther to laugh like that than sing like
Robinson Crusoe in the victrola,&rdquo; said Bobby.
&ldquo;I kin holler real loud but I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; of a big
laugher. Josh, he don&rsquo;t make no noise &rsquo;tall when
he laughs. He jist shakes his innards. He was
shakin&rsquo; em this morning &rsquo;cause Susan said she
had a bee sting on her toe, the reason she is
a-limpin&rsquo; so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen and Douglas exchanged glances with the
young men, whom they had informed of their
suspicions regarding the humorous Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas,&rdquo; said Miss Somerville, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see
why Bobby should use the language of a negro.
He is quite old enough to begin to speak properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Cousin Lizzie, he is really nothing
but a baby, and Mother and Father have
never corrected him because Father said he would
drop it soon enough and he thinks it is so
amusing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baby, your grandmother! I am &rsquo;most a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
an&rsquo; Josh is goin&rsquo; ter learn me how to say we uns
an&rsquo; you uns like he does. He says his teacher
an&rsquo; Gwen is tryin&rsquo; to make him talk properer, but
he ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to talk no way but what his four
bears talks. I wish I had four bears what could
talk. I forgot to ask Josh to tell me about them
bears but I will, some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE AVENGING ANGEL.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Josh,&rdquo; said Lewis to the mountain boy, whose
blue eyes had an extra twinkle in them that morning
as he hitched his mule to a nearby pine tree,
waiting for orders, &ldquo;are you afraid of hornets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if we uns kin git some kerosene smeared
on in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you smear on some kerosene in time
and go get that hornet&rsquo;s nest out of Susan&rsquo;s
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, bless Bob! How did you uns know we
uns put it thar under her bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind how I knew it. You just go and
get it and take it far from the camp and then
come back here and report for work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh winked at Josephus and went to do Mr.
Somerville&rsquo;s bidding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t look mad,&rdquo; thought Josh. &ldquo;I hope
he ain&rsquo;t mad with we uns.&rdquo; Josh had met his idol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in Lewis Somerville. Boylike he admired
strength more than anything in the world, and
could not this young giant lift a log and place it
on his shoulders and carry it to the desired spot
as easily as he himself could carry a twig? There
was a poetical streak in this mountain boy, too,
that saw in Lewis the young knight. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
nothin&rsquo; to fool a nigger,&rdquo; he comforted himself
by saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said cheerfully to Lewis, &ldquo;the
hornets is all good as dead. What must we uns
do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are going to take your punishment
for being no gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentleman! Huh! We uns ain&rsquo;t never set
up to be no gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that. When I hired you to
come work for my cousins, I understood, of
course, that you were a gentleman. Otherwise I
would not have considered you for a moment.
Do you suppose I would have any one come
around these ladies who are everything in the
world to me if he were not a gentleman?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that nigger, Oscar! We uns is as
good as he is. He ain&rsquo;t no gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is as good a gentleman as there is in the
land. He came up here with these young ladies
whom he has known ever since they were babies
rather than desert them when he thought he
might be needed. I have never known Oscar to
say a coarse word or do an ungentle act. I, too,
have known him all my life. He is a good, clean
man, inside and out, and would cut off his hand
before he would scare a helpless woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twan&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but a nigger &rsquo;ooman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say nothing but a negro as though that
were the lowest thing in the world, and still just
now you spoke with a certain pride of being as
good as one. Now I tell you, you are not as
good as one unless you act better. You have a
long line of free English ancestors behind you
and these poor things are but recently out of
slavery. Now you come with me and take your
punishment if you want to stay and work for this
camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh looked rather startled. Did this young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
gentleman mean to beat him, and all because he
had put a hornet&rsquo;s nest under a silly colored girl&rsquo;s
bed? Josh had received many a licking from his
raw-boned mother, and when Aunt Mandy
whipped, she whipped. He was not afraid of the
physical hurt of a beating, but that line of English
ancestors of which Lewis had spoken all rebelled
in this, their little descendant, against being
beaten by any one who was no blood kin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;March!&rdquo; said Lewis.</p>

<p>Well, if he were to go to execution like a soldier,
he could stand it better. With flashing eyes
and head well up, Josh walked on by Lewis&rsquo;s
side.</p>

<p>The camp builders had fashioned, with great
ingenuity, a shower bath to one side of the
kitchen and store-room under the pavilion. The
mountain spring was dug out into a very respectable
reservoir, and this was piped down to
furnish running water in the kitchen and a strong
shower in this rough lean-to of a bath-room.
The water was cold and clear and the fall was
so great that the spray felt like needles. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
young men reveled in this vigorous bathing and
the Carter girls had taken a go at it and one and
all pronounced it grand.</p>

<p>Josh looked upon this enthusiasm on the subject
of mere bathing as affectation. Miss Somerville
might have had the same attitude of mind
towards persons who liked Limberger cheese or
read Sanskrit for pleasure.</p>

<p>Lewis directed his prisoner to this bath-house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, we uns ain&rsquo;t gonter git licked befo&rsquo;
the niggers,&rdquo; thought Josh with some satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now take off your clothes,&rdquo; said Lewis
sternly.</p>

<p>So he was more thorough than his mother.
She contented herself with tickling him on his
bare legs, and if the black snake whip could cut
through the thin rags he called clothes, all well
and good. Josh never remembered her having
tackled him in a state of nature. He made no
demur, however. If this, his idol, chose to beat
him naked, he could do it. He hoped he would
draw the blood just so he, Josh, could show these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
people from the valley how a mountain boy
could take what was coming to him without a
whimper.</p>

<p>He dropped the ragged shirt and trousers that
constituted his entire clothing and stood before
the avenging hero, a thin, wiry little figure about
the color of a new potato that has but recently
left its bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sir!&rdquo; he flung out defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand in the middle of the room,&rdquo; and Lewis
began to roll up his shirt sleeves. Josh closed his
eyes for a moment. Where was the stick or
whip? Did the young gentleman mean to spank
him like a baby? That would be too much.
Even Aunt Mandy had given up spanking years
and years ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh jumped as something struck him suddenly
and remembered, as a drowning man
might, an incident in his childhood when Aunt
Mandy was still in the spanking era. She had
gone for him with a hair brush and had inadvertently
turned the brush up-side-down and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had got the full benefit of the bristles on his bare
hide.</p>

<p>Lewis had turned on the shower full force and
the little new potato was emerging from its coating
of Mother Earth. Gasping and spluttering,
Josh stood his ground. He wanted to run into a
far corner to escape this terrible fusillade, but
an inward grit that was greater than the outward
show made him stay in the spot where his
commander had first placed him. Lewis gradually
lessened the force of the shower and once
more the culprit could breathe. He gave a long,
gasping sigh and then grinned into the face of
his monitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, that was the wust beatin&rsquo; we uns ever
got! Somehow all the nigger-hate ain&rsquo;t washed
out&rsquo;n we unses&rsquo; hide yit. Mebbe you uns had best
turn it on agin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, but take this soap first and lather
yourself all over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was more than Josh had bargained for,
but the soap was nice and fresh smelling and the
lather came without labor. This form of ablution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was very different from what Josh had been
accustomed to. His idea of a bath had always
been first the toting of much water from the
spring, a truly difficult task, for, with the short
sightedness of country people, of course their
cabin was built far above the spring instead of
below it. This letting gravity help do the work
is a comparatively new thing and one that country
people have not generally adopted. Then, to
Josh, the bath meant chopping of more wood to
make the fire to heat the water. Then a steaming
wash tub and the doughty Aunt Mandy
equipped with a can of foul-smelling, home-made
soft soap and a scrubbing brush.</p>

<p>This delightful tingling of his unaccustomed
skin with the nice white soap was a sensation that
seemed to Josh the most wonderful he had ever
experienced. All of these delights with no labor
attached to the enjoyment of them! Just turn a
handle and there you are, clean and cool, laundried
while you wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kin we uns do this every week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every day, if you&rsquo;ve a mind to. It certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
improves your appearance. Don&rsquo;t you feel
good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessirree! Jes&rsquo; like a mockin&rsquo; bird sounds on a
mornin&rsquo; in May when his wife wants him to come
on and help her build the nes&rsquo; aginst the time
when she has got to lay the eggs, and he wants
to sing all day and jes&rsquo; use las&rsquo; year&rsquo;s nes&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t
know as we uns ever did feel quite so like a&mdash;a&mdash;gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Josh! Now put on your
clothes. Here&rsquo;s a towel. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of
work to do to-day, and you and Josephus must
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, sir! Wish Josephus could a had the
beatin&rsquo; we uns done got. &rsquo;Twould sho have made
him feel like he had a extra feedin&rsquo; er oats. We
uns is &rsquo;bliged to you uns, sir. You uns done
made a gentleman out&rsquo;n we uns an&rsquo; mebbe a few
more showers will turn we uns into a nigger
lover,&rdquo; and Josh&rsquo;s blue eyes twinkled merrily
from the setting of a clean, pink face.</p>

<p>Bobby was the only person not pleased by the
improvement in Josh. &ldquo;Grown-ups is all time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
wantin&rsquo; to clean up folks. Josh was a million
times prettier dirty, an&rsquo; now he can&rsquo;t make choclid
milk no mo&rsquo;. I think Cousin Lewis is done ruint
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that morning, whenever Josh was
wanted and not to be found he could usually be
discovered taking a shower bath. He evidently
felt he must make up for lost time, all those
years when he had gone crusty, as he expressed it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="f8">THE WEEK-ENDERS.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;If the weather only holds!&rdquo; exclaimed Douglas.
&ldquo;This first week-end is the most important
of all. If the boarders have a good time they
will want to come back, and then they will give
us such a good name that others will want to
come, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People who can&rsquo;t rise above mere weather
should be taught a lesson,&rdquo; declared Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, child!&rdquo; from Miss Somerville.
&ldquo;Weather is something no one can rise above. A
week of rain in these mountains would make all
of us ready to kill each other and then commit
suicide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we won&rsquo;t be put to the test,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope not! &lsquo;Continual dripping on a
rainy day&rsquo; is a proverbial evil. I hope some
bridge players will be numbered among the
guests. I am hungry for a game.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Cousin Lizzie, you know we don&rsquo;t mind
playing a bit,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask
us whenever you want to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind playing? Bless you, child! Who
wants to play with people who play because they
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t mind playing&rsquo;? I can see that game now!
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s trumps?&rsquo; &lsquo;Whose play is it?&rsquo; &lsquo;I thought
I had played!&rsquo; &lsquo;I must have reniged as I find I
have a heart, after all.&rsquo; No, no! When I play
cards, I want the game made up of devotees.
How would you like a partner in the dance who
danced merely out of good-nature and kept forgetting
whether he was dancing the schottische
or mazurka?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As no one had danced either of those obsolete
dances for at least thirty years, the girls could
not help a few sly smiles.</p>

<p>How rapidly that first week had flown! They
had settled now into regular camp life, even Miss
Somerville. She had secretly decided that Nature
was not half bad and had once found herself
admiring a sunset. She had kept her admiration
to herself, however, for fear some over-zealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
person might make her get up and see a sunrise.</p>

<p>Oscar and Susan, with Gwen doing the head
work, had managed the cooking beautifully for
the few people they had to serve. It remained to
be seen how things would go when the boarders
poured in for the week-end.</p>

<p>Pour in they did, six more than the girls had
prepared for; but Lewis and Bill with their ready
inventions made beds for the boys of spruce
boughs, and immediately put in an order for more
cots and an extra tent.</p>

<p>There were two careful mammas who had
come along to look after their daughters and an
old bachelor who had a niece in tow; so Cousin
Lizzie made up her table of bridge and every one
was happy, especially the daughters of the careful
mammas and the niece who was in tow. If
one must be chaperoned, it is certainly pleasant
to have the chaperone interested in something besides
chaperoning.</p>

<p>The Mountain Goat made three round trips to
the station to meet passengers on the afternoon
train on that first Friday, and other enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
campers walked up the mountain. Josephus was
very busy with a cart full of bags and bundles.
One of the stipulations that the girls had made in
their advertisements was that every one must
bring his or her own blankets. This was at the
instigation of Dr. Wright, who said it would be
very difficult to furnish blankets enough; and also
for sanitary reasons he knew it to be wise.
Sheets are easy to have washed, but blankets are
not so simple a proposition.</p>

<p>The twenty week-enders were all young with
the exception of the two careful mammas, the
old bachelor with the niece in tow, and two stiff-backed
spinsters who must have had some good
reason of their own for coming to camp in the
mountains but they did not give it. They looked
very grim and uncompromising as they sat on the
back seat of the Goat with a plump and pleasing
little stenographer, who was to take her much-needed
holiday at the camp, wedged in between
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be geologists,&rdquo; whispered Douglas
to Lewis. Douglas and Lucy had gone to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
station to meet the newcomers, while Helen and
Nan were to receive them at camp. &ldquo;One of
them had a little hammer sticking out of her
pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hope they will keep their hammers
for rocks and not knock the camp with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I did an awfully foolish thing?
I put Tillie Wingo on the front seat with Bill and
forgot to introduce them. Helen would never
have done such a tactless thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, a small thing like an introduction here
or there won&rsquo;t stop Tillie. I bet she talks poor
Bill blue in the face,&rdquo; laughed Lewis.</p>

<p>So she did. Miss Hill, the pleasant stenographer,
told Helen that not for one moment did
Tillie stop talking on that zig-zag ride up the
mountain. She poured forth a stream of delightful
high-pitched nothings into Bill&rsquo;s crimson ear.
Bill, as was his habit, said nothing, and, like the
tar baby, kept on saying nothing. She had his
ear; his eye must perforce remain on the perilous
road; his tongue was his to hold, and he held it.
Once he let forth a great laugh which had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
effect of shutting Tillie up for almost thirty seconds;
but it was not time to go to sleep yet and
Tillie was accustomed to talk until she went to
sleep and sometimes even afterwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week-end camp is a most original idea and
every one in Richmond is simply wild about it.
You see, the Carters are very popular and if they
decide to do something, lots of people will want
to be doing it, too. Helen Carter is considered
the best dressed girl in Richmond, not that she
dresses more than any of the other girls but she
has such good taste. All of us girls are wild
about her clothes. I adore camping! I&rsquo;d join
the Camp-Fire but somehow khaki is not becoming
to me. Do you know, I do not think that
muddy tan is becoming to decided blondes&mdash;not
that I am such a very decided blonde. I know
lots of girls who wear it who are not near so
highly colored as I am&mdash;but somehow I think tan
takes all the life out of a blonde. Of course, one
can wear white up close to the face, but even then
the tan kind of ruins a blonde complexion. I prefer
blue and pink and lavender and green and, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
course, yellow, and I think grey is just sweet for
a blonde. I am wild for a black dress but my
mother is so old-fashioned she thinks no one under
thirty should wear black unless, of course,
there happens to be a death in the family. Under
those circumstances, I fancy she would let me
wear black. I would not wear heavy mourning
but just some diaphanous, gauzy thing with tulle&mdash;although
I do think that organdy collars and
cuffs set one off terrifically well. I think I would
make a splendid widow&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was here that Bill gave his great guffaw,
but it was also at a particularly ticklish place in
the road, so he could not look at his blonde
passenger.</p>

<p>Tillie stopped for the aforesaid thirty seconds
and then decided that the dumb young man running
the car was a common chauffeur and perhaps
she had better change her form of conversation
to one not suggesting equality. It never
entered her head to stop talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richmond is just running over with jitneys
now. They make such a dust you can&rsquo;t see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
whether they are coming or going. Did you ever
run a jitney? They say there is lots of money in
them. I should think you would do better doing
that than doing this&mdash;of course, though, you know
best, and perhaps you get your board thrown in
up here. Mamma said she knew that the Carter
girls would not know how to feed people because
they have always led such soft lives, but I said I
was coming, anyhow. I am dying to fall off. I
really should have walked up the mountain instead
of riding as that would be a good way to
start, but I had on my best shoes and I knew it
would ruin them. Douglas Carter wrote me to
be sure and bring a blanket, but I simply could
not get one in my grip and I said I would sleep
cold before I would be seen carrying a great old
blanket over my arm like lots of these people. It
was horribly hot in Richmond and I did not think
it could be cold coming just this little way. I
think it is so brave and noble for the Carter girls
to try to help their father this way. They do say
he is dippy and was quite wild-eyed. I have a
friend who was on the sleeper with Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Carter when they went to New York, and he says
they shut themselves up in the drawing room and
acted awful queer. He didn&rsquo;t say just how, but it
must have been something fierce. What is this
funny looking place? Is this the camp? My,
ain&rsquo;t it odd? I am very much obliged to you for
bringing me up. Please look after my suitcase
for me&mdash;it is the large one, really a small trunk,
but I had no idea of mashing my new pink into a
pulp just for the sake of reducing my luggage.
Here, this is for you&mdash;and please get my baggage,&rdquo;
and Tillie handed the astonished Bill a
quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I just took it,&rdquo;
Bill told Lewis afterward. &ldquo;First money I&rsquo;ve
earned since I was a kid and picked blackberries
for Grandmother to jam, at five cents a quart.
Dog, if I would not rather pick the berries,
briars and all! I felt like hollering to somebody
to throw something over the cage, that
the canary was making such a fuss I couldn&rsquo;t
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh, too, was the victim of tips but he indignantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
returned the money that was proffered
him with this remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns ain&rsquo;t beholden to nobody, but is employed
regular by Mr. Somerville, we uns and
Josephus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is often the spirit of the mountaineer.
He will sell anything but cannot stomach a tip.</p>

<p>Helen and Nan received the guests as they
piled out of the Mountain Goat or came up the
winding road on foot. It was a very exciting
moment for our girls. This was really the beginning
of their great adventure. Were they to
succeed or not? The week-enders were there,
for once at least, but could these girls make it so
agreeable that they would want to come back?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do look at Tillie Wingo, Nan! Did you ever
see such a goose? She has on ten dollar champagne
shoes and a blue Georgette crêpe that
would melt in a mist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is some goose, but she will pay us
just as sensible board as anybody else, so we
must not be too critical,&rdquo; and Nan went forward
to meet the pretty blonde Tillie and the stiff-backed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
spinsters and the pleasant Miss Hill, and
Helen smothered her indignation at Tillie&rsquo;s bad
taste in being so unsuitably dressed for camping
and did her best to make it pleasant for her,
Georgette crêpe, champagne shoes and all.</p>

<p>There was much enthusiasm from the new arrivals
as they inspected the camp. Every one
went into ecstasies over the view and the arrangements.
Miss Somerville awaited them in
the pavilion, where she stood as at a reception, receiving
the guests with great formality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These young persons must understand fully
that I am the chaperone, and I think a dignified
reception of them will be conducive to good behavior
on their part,&rdquo; she had said to Helen as
she dressed herself in a black silk afternoon gown
and arranged her beautiful white hair in its shining
puffs.</p>

<p>At Gwen&rsquo;s instigation, afternoon tea was
served as soon as the formal reception was over&mdash;tea
for those so inclined and grape-juice-lemonade
for the more frivolous.</p>

<p>A card table was unfolded for Miss Somerville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the two anxious mothers and the old bachelor
with a niece in tow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite like the springs,&rdquo; whispered Cousin
Lizzie to Helen, as she got brand new packs of
cards for the opening game of the season.</p>

<p>Our girls had thought they would have to be
quite busy entertaining the week-enders, but they
found to their delight that they could entertain
themselves. There were more than enough of
the male element to go around and in an incredibly
short time they had sorted themselves to their
mutual satisfaction and were either dancing to
the latest record, which Tillie Wingo had put in
her bursting semi-trunk, in lieu of a blanket, or
were roaming over the mountain side.</p>

<p>Lil Tate, Lucy&rsquo;s boon companion and school-mate,
had come and the two girls had gone off
arm in arm, while Frank Maury, a callow youth
of fifteen, walked shyly after them, hoping they
would take him in their train and fearing every
moment that they might. His hopes and fears
were both realized and by supper time the three
were sworn allies; Frank had determined to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
up the next week and bring Skeeter, his chum,
and Lil had declared she was going to make her
mother let her spend the whole summer with
Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s an awful &rsquo;fraid cat about me and
just would come along. Thank goodness, she
and Miss Somerville have got cards to occupy &rsquo;em
and she has forgotten there isn&rsquo;t but one of me,&rdquo;
laughed Lil, who was a sprightly little brunette.
&ldquo;I wisht I had been born triplets and then she
wouldn&rsquo;t have to be so particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m glad I ain&rsquo;t a girl&mdash;but I like girls a
lot&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Frank. &ldquo;Skeeter and I think
they are just great,&rdquo; and so they chattered on.</p>

<p>Bobby was not so happy. His friend Josh was
too busy with Josephus and the luggage to have
him around, and no boon companion had arrived
for him. He had been made to wash and dress,
which, he considered, was a great breach of
faith on the part of his sisters. He had it firmly
placed in his memory that he had been promised
by some one that when he got to the mountains he
would never have to wash and dress. He sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with a very disconsolate mien in a corner of the
pavilion, watching Tillie&rsquo;s pretty little feet in
their champagne shoes twirling round and
around, every few moments with another pair of
masculine shoes accompanying them, as Tillie
was never long without a flock of the opposite
sex in her wake. She could hardly get around
the pavilion before the dance was broken into by
some eager swain. She was noted as being able
to dance down more partners than any girl in
Richmond, and it was slyly hinted that she was so
long-winded because of her never ceasing practice
in conversation.</p>

<p>Bobby looked gloomily at the twinkling feet.
They were too clean for him, those champagne-colored
shoes. His own feet were disgustingly
clean, too. Maybe he could rectify that with a
judicious sprinkling of grape juice and then some
clay sifted over them. He would try! Just then
the stiff-backed spinsters, who turned out to be
educators off on a botanical and geological spree,
bore down on him and seating themselves on each
side of him began:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Little boy, are you enjoying your stay in the
mountains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, perhaps you are too idle and need occupation.
Can you read and write?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, I can&rsquo;t read writin&rsquo; but I can read
readin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have a task set you every day and
then vacation would not hang so heavily on your
hands. Some useful bit of information imparted
to you would be edifying and useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! That&rsquo;s the way Cousin Lizzie talks.
She&rsquo;s our chapel roan an&rsquo; knows mo&rsquo;n anybody
&rsquo;bout Solomon an&rsquo; all his glory. She done learnt
me a verse already onct this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed! And can you repeat it to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I reckon &rsquo;twas the grape juice an&rsquo; victrola
that made her choose this one: &lsquo;Wine is a
mucker an&rsquo; strong drink is rag time.&rsquo; I kin learn
mos&rsquo; anything,&rdquo; and Bobby hastened off to put
the clay on his feet before the grape juice bath
had time to dry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="f8">LETTERS FROM WEEK-END CAMP.</span></h2>


<p class="center">From Tillie Wingo to Her Best Friend Grace.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="in2">Greendale, Va.</span><br />
Saturday Morning.</p>

<p>My darling Grace:</p>

<p>Such a time as we are having&mdash;I&rsquo;ve almost
danced up my new ten dollar shoes, but I am
sure glad I wore them as they have been much
admired. There are oodlums of men up here and
some of the prettiest dancers I have ever met.</p>

<p>I must tell you what a terrible break I made.
There is a man here named Bill Tinsley, and do
you know I took him for a jitney driver the first
day I got here and gave him a tip&mdash;twenty-five
cents. He took it like a mutt and now he has a
hole in it and wears it around his neck and everybody
thinks it is an awful joke on me. I must
say that it is hard to tell one kind of man from
another when nobody introduces you. He is
awful dum but dances like Volinine. He never
opens his face except to feed it and to laugh and
he laughs louder and more than anybody I have
ever met before.</p>

<p>Speaking of feeding, the eats are fine. I don&rsquo;t
see how the Carter girls ever learned how to do
it but they have the best things! I hoped it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
would be bum as I want to fall off. I have always
been a perfect thirty-six and must say I
don&rsquo;t relish taking on flesh, but I can&rsquo;t resist fried
chicken and waffles.</p>

<p>I am almost sorry I brought my new pink as I
really need some kind of outing dress, but I did
not have room for so many things and I do think
that it is best to have plenty of dancing frocks
rather than sport suits that after all do not become
me very much.</p>

<p>We have chaperones to burn as Miss Elizabeth
Somerville is here and Mrs. Tate may stay a long time
so Lil can be here with Lucy Carter. I am
dying to stay but $2.00 per is right steep
for yours truly. I don&rsquo;t think that is much for
what you get and I think the Carter girls are real
smart to charge a good price as long as they are
giving you good things. Helen Carter does a lot
of the cooking and has the sweetest little bungalow
aprons to cook in. They are pink and blue,
just my style, and when I get a trousseau I intend
to have one.</p>

<p>We danced last night until eleven and then old
Miss Somerville made all of us go to bed. She
couldn&rsquo;t see to play cards was the reason she was
so proper. Little dinky kerosene lamps that blow
out in the wind are not much for card playing but
they do fine for dancing. The boys say they are
going to bring up some electric lanterns the next
week-end so the old lady can see to play and she
will forget the time.</p>

<p>Did you ever sleep in a tent, Grace? Well, it
is great&mdash;I was real sorry I didn&rsquo;t have a blanket
when it blew up so cold. It was right down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
nippy. I wasn&rsquo;t going to say a thing but I was
sorry I hadn&rsquo;t even brought a sweater&mdash;one of
the fellows didn&rsquo;t have a blanket either but I
heard him say he was going to sleep in his clothes.
A blue Georgette crêpe and a pink chiffon
wouldn&rsquo;t help me much and all of my clothes are
diaphanous this summer. I am sharing a tent
with two old maids and a sten from Richmond.
Do you know when I went to my tent I found six
blankets on my cot and Susan the maid brought
me two more? It had got out among the men
that I didn&rsquo;t have a blanket, how I can&rsquo;t imagine,
and they sent me theirs. Now wasn&rsquo;t that too
sweet of them? I sent them all back but a lovely
cadet blue&mdash;it was so becoming I chose that. It
turned out to be Mr. Tinsley&rsquo;s so I believe he is
not mad about the tip I gave him.</p>

<p>We are going on a walk this morning over to
a terrible place called the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge. I am
going to wear Lucy Carter&rsquo;s shoes and Nan&rsquo;s
skirt and Helen&rsquo;s middy blouse and Douglas has
a hat for me. The sten in the tent with me lent
me some stockings. You see I brought nothing
but silk ones. After we got to bed last night and
I was almost asleep but was talking to the sten,
who is a very nice agreeable girl&mdash;the old maids
were both snoring&mdash;we heard a car chugging up
the hill and it seems two more men had arrived,
motored all the way from Richmond. It was a
Dr. Wright and a boy named Dick. I heard
Helen Carter, in the next tent, just raising Cain
and saying he was very inconsiderate to come in
on them at night that way, but before they could
so much as get up to see where they were to sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
they got a message that the new comers had
brought their own blankets and hammocks and
no one was to stir for them. I met Dr. Wright
at breakfast and I think he is real cute. Helen
Carter is mighty rude to him and I can&rsquo;t see how
he stands it. Helen has lovely manners usually
but she certainly does pick him up quick. He is
a general favorite with the rest of the family
though, and Bobby is just wild about him. No
more at present. I don&rsquo;t see how I ever wrote
this much as there has been a lot of noise and I
know ten times I have been begged to stop writing
and come dance. It looks like rain but I do
hope it won&rsquo;t. My blue will melt I know if it
rains.</p>

<p class="center">Skeeter from Frank Maury.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Hello Skeeter!</p>

<p>Come in, the water&rsquo;s fine! Say, Skeeter,
what&rsquo;s the reason you can&rsquo;t light right out and
come up to camp? Be sure and bring a blanket,
the nights are cold as flugians. Miss Douglas
Carter says that they call it a week-end camp just
for cod, but we can stay through the week if
we&rsquo;ve a mind. Bully eats and plenty of &rsquo;em, and
say, Skeeter, two mighty prime girls&mdash;no nonsense
about them but spunky and up to snuff.
They are named Lucy Carter and Lil Tate.
They say they&rsquo;d like to meet you a lot. If you
come we can play five hundred when we are not
climbing the mountains and hunting bee trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Lucy has some chores she has to do but Lil and I
help and we get through in a jiffy. It is just fun.
I talk like I been here a month and it is just one
night. Anyhow, Lil and I helped this morning
and we are going to do it every morning. You
see, these Carter girls are running this camp for
the spondulix they can get out of it and it means
all of them have got to spit on their hands and
turn in. Lucy has to help wipe the dishes when
they have many folks. I blew in the glasses and
polished them so fine that Miss Helen said she
would like to hire me. I ain&rsquo;t going to tell you
more of the camp because I am sure you will be
here yourself soon. It beats the beach all hollow.
These girls are sure slick, these Carter girls.
They have a camp fire going all the time to make
it look al frescoish, but they do their cooking
mostly on stoves and in fireless cookers. They
roast the potatoes in the camp fire and bring them
to the table with ashes on &rsquo;em to make &rsquo;em look
more campyfied; and they have a big iron pot
hanging over the fire but they never have anything
in it but water. Say, Skeeter, when you
come, bring your fish lines as there is a stream
that looks like fish. Let a fellow know when to
look for you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<span class="f8">THE HIKE.</span></h2>


<p>You could plainly see the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge from
Camp Carter, that is, you could see a dent in the
neighboring mountain, and no one but Josh
knew that it was two hours&rsquo; steady walking to
that purplish dimple. Two hours&rsquo; steady walking
is not possible with twenty-odd persons, and
so it took nearer four to reach the end of their
journey. There were many pauses to rest and to
tie shoe strings and refresh themselves at gurgling
springs. Josh led the way with Josephus as
pack mule, the lunch strapped on his back and
Bobby perched on top like a Great Mogul.</p>

<p>Josephus was at a great disadvantage as his
short fore leg was down hill. &ldquo;Never mind, he&rsquo;ll
play thunder goin&rsquo; back,&rdquo; Josh consoled himself
and Bobby, who had to sit very carefully to keep
from falling off on the down side. Josephus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
limped cheerfully on as though there were nothing
he enjoyed more than a hike where he was
allowed to carry the lunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is such a cheerful old mule that I just
know if he had been born a canary bird he would
be singing all the time,&rdquo; declared Nan. &ldquo;I think
he has a most enviable disposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, his disposition is more to be envied than
his job,&rdquo; suggested one of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we will lighten his load for him
before we return. I am starved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it that is hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, me!&rdquo; from so many mouths that the educating
spinsters&rsquo; precise &ldquo;I, I,&rdquo; was lost in the
avalanche of me&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Those worthy ladies were in a seventh heaven
of bliss. They had found many botanical specimens
which they pounced upon for future analysis,
and their little hammers were going whack!
whack! at every boulder that poor Josephus
stumbled over. They were really very nice and
kind, and as for their backbones, it was not their
fault that they had pokers instead of vertebrae.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The Devil&rsquo;s Gorge was worth the long walk,
even to those who had no hammers. Great rocks
were piled high on top of one another and all
down the mountain side was an enormous crack
in solid rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geewhiz! Something must have been doing
here once to make such a mess,&rdquo; declared Lewis
Somerville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just look at that great rock balanced there on
that little one! It would take just a push to send
it clattering down. To think that one great
heave of Mother Earth must have sent it up, and
there it has been just as it is for centuries!&rdquo; said
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we uns bets Mr. Bill could send it over
with one er his side splitters.&rdquo; And with that
from Josh, Bill gave a sample of his laugh that
did not dislodge the great boulder but made Tillie
Wingo stop talking for a whole minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You uns ain&rsquo;t lowing to eat here, is you uns?&rdquo;
asked Josh rather plaintively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a pretty good place,&rdquo; suggested
Dr. Wright, who had found a pleasant companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in Miss Hill although he had made some endeavor
at first to walk beside Helen. But that young
lady swished her cold-gravy corduroy skirt by
him and refused to be walked beside. Helen was
looking particularly charming on that day, although
she could but confess to herself that she
was a little tired. Making sandwiches for such a
lot of persons was no joke, and she had been at it
for hours before they started on the hike. She
had had plenty of helpers, but sandwiches were
her particular stunt and she had had a finger in
every one.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright&rsquo;s last glimpse of Helen as she had
sat in the coach of the moving train, telling a
truly true made-up story to Bobby, had remained
a very pleasant picture in his mind. He had decided
that there was a lot of sweetness in the girl
and certainly a great deal of cleverness and
charm&mdash;if she would only not feel that her thorny
side was the one always to be presented to him.
When he had handed her the aromatic ammonia
for Douglas and she had thanked him so sweetly,
he had felt that surely the hatchet was buried between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
them and now they were to be friends.
He had been thinking of her a good deal during
the past week and had quite looked forward to
the possibility of becoming better acquainted with
her.</p>

<p>Helen had really meant to be nice, but on the
young doctor&rsquo;s arrival a spirit of perverseness
had seized her and she had her thorns all ready to
prick him whenever he approached her, hoping
for some share of the sweetness she could lavish
on others: on Bobby, for instance. That youngster
always declared Helen was his favorite sister,
and there was never a time when Bobby was
too dirty or too naughty for Helen to think he
was not the sweetest and most kissable thing in
the world. As Bobby&rsquo;s conversation when he was
with his &rsquo;ployer was taken up a great deal with
Helen, and vice versa, those two young persons
perforce heard much of one another. Helen
was grateful to Dr. Wright for his kindness to
Bobby and at the same time was a little
jealous of Bobby&rsquo;s affection and admiration for
him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; she would argue to herself,
&ldquo;but somehow this man seems always to be putting
me in the wrong, and now he even has Bobby
loving him more than he does me, and as for the
girls&mdash;they make me tired!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That very morning when they were dressing
for the hike and she was putting on her cold-gravy
corduroy skirt, grey pongee shirtwaist and
grey stockings and canvas shoes&mdash;all thought out
with care even to the soft grey summer felt hat
and the one touch of color: a bright red tie
knotted under the soft rolling collar&mdash;she had
been irritated almost to a point of tears because
Nan, who was all ready, came running back into
the tent to put on some khaki leggins because Dr.
Wright said it would be wise to wear them, as
a place like the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge was sure to be
snaky. Douglas and Lucy had done the same
thing and had wanted her to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I won&rsquo;t! How did he happen to be the
boss of this camp? His power of attorney does
not extend to me, I&rsquo;ll have him know! Besides,
do you think I am going to ruin the whole effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of my grey costume with those old mustard colored
leggins? Not on your life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen is very tired; that&rsquo;s what makes her
so unreasonable,&rdquo; Nan had whispered to Douglas
as they left the tent to Helen and her costume.
&ldquo;She has worked so hard all morning on the sandwiches.
When I finished the deviled eggs, I
wanted her to let me help, but she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. I was so busy in the tents, making
up cots and straightening up things, that I
had to leave it all to you and Helen, but I thought
Gwen and Susan were there to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they were, but Susan has a slap dash way
of making sandwiches that does not appeal to
Helen, and while Gwen is very capable, she cannot
take the initiative in anything unless she has
been taught it at school. The next time we make
sandwiches she will do it much better. She was
so anxious to make them just right that she was
slower than Brer Tarripin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked Gwen to go with us this morning, but
she shrank back in such horror at the mention of
the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge that I realized I had been cruel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
indeed, to speak of the place to her. That&rsquo;s
where her father killed himself, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor girl! Doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange that
there were no papers of any sort found to show
where he came from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Dr. Wright joined them and they
told him of the little English girl and how her
father had killed himself and how, there being no
papers to show that he had made a payment on
the mountain property, Old Dean, the country
storekeeper, had foreclosed at the Englishman&rsquo;s
death and the property had later been given to
their father in payment of a debt Dean owed him
for services in rebuilding the hotel at Greendale,
also owned by Dean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mandy says it was only about a thousand
dollars in all,&rdquo; explained Douglas, &ldquo;and she
was under the impression that Mr. Brown had
paid cash for the land, but he was so reticent no
one knew much about him and old Dean said
that he had never paid anything. Of course
Dean is the rich member of the community and
gives them credit at his store, so all the mountaineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
are under his thumb, more or less. Father
got only half the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Helen appeared, she fancied Dr. Wright
looked disapprovingly at her because of her legginless
state, but on the contrary he was thinking
what a very delightful looking person she was
and never even thought of leggins. He only
thought how nice it would be if she would permit
him to walk by her side and hold back the low
hanging branches and briars so that her bright,
animated face would escape the inevitable
scratches that attend a hike in the mountains.
He liked the way she walked, carrying her head
and shoulders in rather a gallant way. He liked
the sure-footed way she stepped along in her
pretty grey canvas ties. He liked the set and
hang of her corduroy skirt and the roll of the soft
collar of her shirt&mdash;above all, he liked the little
dash of red at her throat. She reminded him of
a scarlet tanager, only they were black, and she
was grey, grey like a dove&mdash;but there was certainly
nothing dovelike about her, certainly nothing
meek or cooing as she swished by him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>No one laughed more or chattered more than
Helen did on that hike, not even Tillie Wingo herself,
the queen bee of laughers and chatterers; but
Nan noticed that the last mile of their walk her
sister&rsquo;s carriage was not nearly so gallant, and
Dr. Wright noticed that the scarlet of her tie
was even more brilliant because of an unwonted
paleness of her piquant face. He tapped his
breast pocket to be sure that the tiny medicine
case he always carried with him was safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never can tell what will happen when a
lot of youngsters start off on a hike, and it is well
to have &lsquo;first aid to the injured&rsquo; handy,&rdquo; he had
said to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wal, if you uns is lowing to eat here, reckon
we uns will drive Josephus round the mounting a
bit. We uns feels like it&rsquo;s a feedin&rsquo; the Devil
and starvin&rsquo; God to eat in sech a spot,&rdquo; and Josh
prepared to unload his mule after he had assisted
Bobby to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t eat here,&rdquo; begged Nan, &ldquo;this
is where the Englishman died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo; the others demanded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Josh, nothing loath to tell the dramatic incident
and emboldened by the crowd and broad daylight,
when hants were powerless, told again the tale
of the man with the sad, tired face who was
always trying to get away from the ringing and
roaring in his head; how he had drifted into
Greendale and bought the land with the cabin on
it from old Dean and taken his little girl up there
where they had lived about two years; and then
how one night he had not come home, and Gwen
had come to their cabin early in the morning to
ask them to hunt her father, and after long
search they had found him down in the Devil&rsquo;s
Gorge&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead&rsquo;s a door nail and Gwen left &rsquo;thout so
much as a sho &rsquo;nuf name, &rsquo;cause the Englishman
allus called hisself Brown, but the books what
Gwen fetched to we allses&rsquo; house is got another
name writ in &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; my maw, she says that
Gwen&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; as likely to be named one as tother.
My maw says that she don&rsquo;t hold to the notion
that the Englishman took his own life, but that
was what the coroner said&mdash;susanside&mdash;an&rsquo; accordin&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to law we uns is bleeged to accept his
verdict.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree with your mother,&rdquo; said Dr. Wright.
&ldquo;It is more apt to have been vertigo that toppled
the poor man over. That ringing in the head is
so often accompanied with vertigo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They carried the provisions around the mountain,
out of sight of the gruesome spot, and under
a mighty oak tree ate their very good luncheon.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="f8">FIRST AID.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;It is strange we haven&rsquo;t seen a single snake,&rdquo;
said one of the visiting girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness for it!&rdquo; exclaimed another.
&ldquo;I was almost afraid to come camping because of
snakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen any around the camp at all,&rdquo;
Douglas assured them.</p>

<p>Bill and Lewis exchanged sly glances, for the
truth of the matter was they had killed several in
the early days when they were breaking ground
for the pavilion&mdash;had killed and kept mum on the
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls are just as afraid of dead snakes as
alive ones, so let&rsquo;s keep dark about them,&rdquo;
Lewis had said, and they had also sworn Josh to
secrecy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing to be remembered about
snakes,&rdquo; said Dr. Wright, &ldquo;most snakes, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
that they are as afraid of you as you are of them
and they are seldom the aggressors; that is, they
do not consider themselves so. They strike when
they think that you have encroached on their
trail. If you look carefully where you walk,
there is no danger ever of being bitten by a snake,
and very few snakes will come deliberately where
you are. I will wager anything that Josh here
has never stepped on a snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We uns done it onct but Maw lambasted we
uns with a black snake whip fer not lookin&rsquo; whar
we uns trod, so&rsquo;s ain&rsquo;t never had no accident
since. Maw, she said if the har of a dog was
good fer the bite, that a black snake whip would
jest about cure we uns fer most gittin&rsquo; bit by a
rattler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he didn&rsquo;t bite you, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, &rsquo;cause we uns war jes up from the
measles an&rsquo; Maw had put some ole boots on we
uns. Maw says that the best cure for snake bite
is to have the measles an&rsquo; wear ole boots so you
uns don&rsquo;t git bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sound reasoning,&rdquo; laughed Dr. Wright.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
&ldquo;In the mountains, top boots or leggins would
cure all snake bites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen wouldn&rsquo;t wear her leggins,&rdquo; declared
Bobby, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause she said you couldn&rsquo;t come
attorney-generaling her about her clothes, and
mustard don&rsquo;t help cold gravy none, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bobby!&rdquo; gasped Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it won&rsquo;t, Bobby,&rdquo; said Dr. Wright, somewhat
mystified as to the hidden meaning of mustard
and cold gravy but feeling sure that there
was some significance in it. He did not interpret
it as did Mrs. Bardell the cryptic notes from Mr.
Pickwick concerning tomato sauce as being love
messages, but well knew that they were more
nearly proofs of dislike if not hate from Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can help cold gravy in my opinion,&rdquo;
drawled Nan, &ldquo;not even heating it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about cold shoulders?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or icy mitts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or glacial reserve?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or chilling silence?&rdquo; Suggestions from different
ones of the picnickers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will melt frigid replies?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Or frozen glances?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hot air!&rdquo; from Bill. &ldquo;Melt anything.&rdquo; And
then he gave a laugh at his own wit that bid fair
to dislodge the great rock so delicately balanced
in the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go explore the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge now!&rdquo; suggested
Helen, springing to her feet, forgetting all
about her fatigue, only thankful for the foolishness
that had been started by Nan to hide her
sister&rsquo;s embarrassment. What would Dr. Wright
think of her? He must have understood very
well what Bobby meant by attorney-generaling,
if the mustard and cold gravy was a mystery.</p>

<p>The girls held back when they looked down the
frightful abyss so well named, but the spinster
educators went on, determined to get geological
specimens if they died for it, and Helen, in a
spirit of bravado, leaped ahead of the exploring
party and sprang down the rocks like a veritable
mountain goat. Her cheeks were still glowing
over the remarks of that enfant terrible, Bobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Helen!&rdquo; called Lewis Somerville,
who had constituted himself squire of spinsters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and was helping those intrepid geologists down
the slippery rocks. Helen tossed her head at her
cousin and went on in her mad descent, swinging
from rock to rock with the occasional help of a
scrub oak that had somehow gained foothold on
the barren boulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for snakes, Helen!&rdquo; cried Douglas,
who had turned back with the rest of the party.</p>

<p>But Helen heeded nothing and seemed bent on
reaching the lowest point of the chasm. It
flashed across her mind that she was a little like
the Englishman. He was trying to escape from
the buzzing and roaring in his head while she was
in a mad race with her conscience. Why should
she be so unkind and sharp with Dr. Wright?
She didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>She could hear the people above talking and
their voices seemed thin and far away, so deep
had she penetrated into the gorge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jest a leetle below whar Miss Helen is standing
was whar they picked up the Englishman,&rdquo;
she could hear Josh&rsquo;s peculiar mountain voice recite
before the party moved off back toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
temporary camp where they had had luncheon.
The ladies on science bent, their squire,
Dr. Wright and she were the only explorers
left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right down there is where that poor man
fell,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was
suicide, either,&rdquo; and then she blushed for agreeing
with Dr. Wright. &ldquo;But it would be so easy to
fall from any of these slippery crags. He might
have been on the opposite cliff, which is certainly
a precarious spot, and vertigo might have attacked
him, and he might have gone over backwards,
clutching at the scrub oaks as he fell, and
gone down, down&mdash;why, what is that hanging in
the tree there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something was certainly caught in the
branches of a dwarf tree that clung to the unfriendly
rocks with determined roots&mdash;something
that looked like a wallet, but she could not be
sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lewis!&rdquo; she called, but Lewis was so taken
up with hanging by his toes and reaching for a
particularly rare specimen of fern that one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
dames wanted for her collection, that he did not
hear her calling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I do?&rdquo; asked Dr. Wright from somewhere
above her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I thank you. I don&rsquo;t want anything.&rdquo;
And then the buzzing conscience started up and
she said more cordially, &ldquo;I see something hanging
in a scrub oak over there that I am going to
get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me get it for you,&rdquo; and the young doctor
started to swing himself down the cliff to the
ledge where Helen was standing.</p>

<p>Before he reached her, however, she had determined
to make the attempt herself. It was not
much of a jump for one as athletic as Helen. It
was several feet below where she was standing
and the gorge narrowed at that point, making little
more than a step across to the opposite ledge.</p>

<p>She gave a flying leap and landed safely,
clutching the scrub oak in whose branches the
wallet was lodged. Dr. Wright reached the spot
where she had been standing just as she touched
the rock below. He could not help admiring her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
grace and athletic figure as she made the jump,
although his heart was sore at her persistent unkindness
to him. He did not want to find her
attractive and determined to let this visit to the
camp be his last. She seemed to think that he
had courted the power of attorney that had been
thrust upon him, or why should she have said
whatever she had said that had caused Bobby&rsquo;s
prattling? It was thoroughly ungenerous of her
and unkind and he for one was not going to place
himself in a position to have to endure it. The
other members of the family were so very nice to
him that he did not relish letting the summer go
by without visiting them again&mdash;and Bobby&mdash;dear
little shover. He could but confess, however,
that their kindness was outweighed in his
heart by Helen&rsquo;s unkindness, and he determined
to stay away.</p>

<p>A second after Helen had made her triumphant
leap, she gave a sharp cry. Dr. Wright started
toward her and his keen gaze saw an ugly snake
gliding away across the rocks, disappearing in a
crevice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My God, Helen! Did he bite you?&rdquo; No bitterness
now was in the young man&rsquo;s heart as he
jumped the chasm and landed by Helen&rsquo;s side,
just as she sank trembling to the ground.</p>

<p>She said afterwards it was not because it hurt
so much, only for a moment was the pain intense,
but she felt a kind of horror as though the poison
had penetrated her very soul. She was filled
with fear that could only have been equalled by
Susan&rsquo;s dread of hants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; the doctor questioned with a
voice of such sympathy and tenderness that
Helen&rsquo;s thoughts went back to a time in her childhood
when she had her tonsils removed. When
she came from under the anesthetic, her father
was holding her hand and he spoke to her in just
such a tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My heel! Just above the shoe!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take off your shoe and stocking as quick as
you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed without question and Dr. Wright,
with a deftness surprising in a man, twisted a
handkerchief around her ankle just above the injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
spot, and so tightly did he bind it, that it
was all Helen could do to keep from crying out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it hurts, but we have to bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His &ldquo;we&rdquo; made her feel in some way that it
hurt him, too. But what was he doing? Without
a word he had knelt and had his mouth to
the wound and was sucking out the poison.</p>

<p>Helen hid her face in her hands. It took only
a moment and then the kind voice said: &ldquo;Now we
have a little more to stand.&rdquo; He quickly opened
his miniature case and, handing her a tiny phial,
told her to take two of the pellets, which she did,
while he got out a small hard alcohol lamp and
lighted it. Then, producing the proper instruments
from the wonderful case, he proceeded to
cauterize the wound. Helen gritted her teeth
and made not one murmur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s own daughter,&rdquo; was all he said
as he put up his instruments, but that was as music
in the ears of Helen. He then produced a
small bottle from another pocket and washed out
his own mouth with a thoroughness that explained
his exceedingly perfect teeth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The wound is a very slight one and I truly
believe you will have absolutely no trouble, but
you must take every precaution and be very quiet
for a day or so. Lewis and I together will carry
you up to Josephus. A snake bite can be of little
consequence if it is taken hold of immediately.
Can you stand the ligature a little tighter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see it is tight enough. You can put
your stocking on again, but first I must make assurance
doubly sure and cut out a great hole
where the rascal attacked you. There might be
poison in it.&rdquo; He deftly bandaged the injured
ankle with a roll of gauze he produced from yet
another pocket, first treating the wound with
iodine. &ldquo;I wish I had some permanganate of
potash but I fancy the work is already done and
the iodine will be all right. He got you on the
Achilles tendon. I wonder if it is your only vulnerable
spot, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not. I am full of vulnerable spots!
Oh, Dr. Wright, I am not nearly so mean as I
seem. I am so sorry I was so rude to you&mdash;I&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
am going to be better. I am sorry I did not wear
the leggins and I am sorry I did not look where
I was stepping&mdash;I am sorry I jumped over the
gorge when I saw you coming. I just did it to
irritate you. I am sorry to have caused you all
this trouble and I am so grateful to you that I can
hardly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but here Helen actually blubbered,
something that she never did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor little girl! I haven&rsquo;t a doubt
that I have been as horrid as you have thought
I was and dictatorial and interfering and mean&mdash;and
everything. Please forgive me and suppose
we just be the good friends that somehow I believe
we were cut out to be, you and Bobby and
I;&rdquo; and he took the girl&rsquo;s hand in his and patted
it gently while she wept on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stop crying, honey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I be&mdash;be&mdash;believe I could if I had a handkerchief,
but I&rsquo;ve lost mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine is made into a ligature. Would a
few yards of gauze help any?&rdquo; And then they
both laughed while he unwound the gauze.</p>

<p>All of this had taken but a few minutes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Lewis and the scientific devotees had no idea
that anything so terrifying as a snake bite was
going on. They came in view just as Helen
dried her eyes on the few yards of gauze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lewis, a snake bit me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! A rattler?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wright held up a warning finger behind
Helen&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got out of the way so fast we did not get
a good look at him, but it is not a bad bite, and
everything has been done that could be done, and
now Miss Helen is going to take one more of
these little green pellets and you and I are going
to carry her up to Josephus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies were very solicitous and anxious to
do anything in their power, but they were calm
and quiet and Helen thanked her stars that the
rest of the party had gone back and not ventured
so far into the gorge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been awful to have them buzzing
all around me, yelling and screaming and
squealing,&rdquo; she said to herself, and then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
thought came to her of the horror all the girls had
of snakes and the consternation her accident
would cause among the week-enders. But why
need they know? It was her own fault that she
had been bitten, and such a thing need never happen
again if only proper precautions were taken,
such as leggins and looking where you stepped
and keeping away from the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge, where
snakes were sure to abound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wright, do you think it would be possible
to keep this thing perfectly quiet? I am so
afraid that my being bitten by a snake would give
our camp such a bad name that it would be a failure
from now on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it could be kept quiet. What do
you think, Somerville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me! Why, I&rsquo;m game to keep my mouth
shut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We agree with you perfectly, Miss Carter,
and will say nothing at all in regard to the accident,&rdquo;
the spinsters assured her, and they looked
so kind and sensible that Helen&rsquo;s heart was
warmed to them and she wondered that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
not noticed before what very intelligent, good
faces both of them had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Dr. Wright, &ldquo;it is perfectly
ethical for a physician to keep his patient&rsquo;s malady
to himself. Miss Helen Carter is suffering
from an injury to her ankle. If the inquisitive
choose to make of it a sprain it is their own affair.
Now, Lewis, how shall we manage? It
will be pretty awkward for us to make a basket
of our hands going up this cliff,&rdquo; and with that
he stooped and picked Helen up in his arms, and
with no more exertion than if she had been
Bobby, he made his way up the mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="#frontis">Would it hurt me to walk? I can&rsquo;t bear to be
so much trouble.</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is best to keep very quiet. I am pretty sure
there is going to be no trouble, but I must have
you behave just exactly as though there was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lewis, you get Douglas off by herself and let
her know what it was, but wait until we are back
in camp. Tell her so she won&rsquo;t be scared, and let
her know it is all right before you let her know
what it is.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the rattlesnake is called crotalus horridus,&rdquo;
said one of the wise ladies.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright wished she would stop talking
about snakes and especially rattlers, as he wanted
to get Helen&rsquo;s mind off the terrifying occurrence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not sure this was a rattlesnake,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was,&rdquo; she whispered to him. &ldquo;I remember
as I jumped I heard something that
sounded like dry leaves.&rdquo; Did the young man
hold her closer to him or was it just a fancy on
her part?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It knocks me all up to think about it,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I am glad, so glad I followed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wave of crimson flooded the young man&rsquo;s
face. He didn&rsquo;t know why, but his blood was
singing in his veins and his breath came quickly.
If it had not been for the presence of the respectable
spinsters, he was sure he would have had to
kiss that piquant face so close to his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Doc, my time now to take up the
white man&rsquo;s burden. Helen is no featherweight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and you are red in the face and panting from
carrying her this far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; and Dr. Wright held on to his
burden while Lewis endeavored to relieve him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s cut the baby in two, like my Aunt&rsquo;s
favorite character in history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I give up, it will be for the same reason
the woman in the Bible did,&rdquo; laughed Dr. Wright.
&ldquo;You remember it was the woman who had the
right who gave up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spinsters were still talking about the habits
and customs of the horridus crotalus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They know so much and keep piling on so much
more, I fancy if they didn&rsquo;t give out some of their
learning, they would bust,&rdquo; whispered Lewis, as
he grasped his cousin in a bear hug and started
to finish the journey to the temporary camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember a limerick, I think Oliver
Hereford&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Helen:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;&lsquo;There was once a homo teetotalus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stepped on a horridus crotalus,<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="f8">THE DIAGNOSIS.</span></h2>


<p>There was a great outcry from the party when
Helen appeared in the arms of Lewis with an ostentatious
bandage on her ankle, so that the verdict
of a sprain was established without the attending
physician&rsquo;s having to perjure himself
with a false diagnosis.</p>

<p>Helen was looking very pale and tired, and
thankful indeed was she for the bony back of
Josephus, that was destined to bear her home.
She and Bobby both found room on the patient
old mule, who started off with his usual bird-like
spirit, seemingly proud of his fair burden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we are too much for Josephus,&rdquo;
Helen said to Josh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw&rsquo;m! Josephus is proud to tote the likes of
you allses. He is jes&rsquo; a been tellin&rsquo; we uns that
he is thankful his short leg is up the mounting so
Miss Helen will ride mo&rsquo; easy like.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give him some sugar when we get
home,&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright kept close by the side of the mule
wherever the trail permitted and once or twice
held out his hand to feel the pulse of the patient.
That is the danger of snake bite: that the pulse
may become feeble. The old treatment of
whisky, drunk in large quantities, is now thought
to have been the cause of more deaths from snake
bites than the bites themselves. Persons unaccustomed
to liquor could not stand the large doses
that were poured down them by well-meaning
friends. The present day treatment is: strychnia
to keep up the pulse and the thorough burning
out of the wound, after it has been sucked by a
healthy mouth.</p>

<p>A sprained ankle is nothing to dampen the spirits
of youth and so the crowd went back as gaily
as it came. Helen could not help thinking how
differently they would have behaved had they
known the true inwardness of her having to ride
on the back of the mule that reminded her of
nothing so much as a saw-horse. Had they understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
that a rattlesnake had taken a nip out of
her tendon Achilles, it would have put an end to
their cheerfulness and also an end to their week-end
boarders if she was not mistaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose it is going to do me as it did old
Uncle Snake-bit Peter we used to see up at
Wytheville,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;with his leg all
drawn up and shrivelled.&rdquo; She got giddy at the
thought and then it was that Dr. Wright, who
seemed to know exactly what was in her mind,
put out his hand and felt her pulse and then gave
her another tiny pellet. He looked so good and
so dependable and seemed so confident that all
was going well with her, she felt she must perforce
have faith in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will look unto the hills from whence cometh
my help,&rsquo;&rdquo; came to her lips, and she whispered
the text softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she blushed, &ldquo;I was talking to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were blowing down my neck,&rdquo; said
Bobby, who was perched in front of her. &ldquo;If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
you were whiskering to me, I didn&rsquo;t hear what
you said. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t perlite to whisker in comp&rsquo;ny,
and, &rsquo;sides, I always tell my &rsquo;ployer what you say
&rsquo;bout him, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was silent. Would she ever be able to
live down all the unkind things she had said about
Dr. Wright? How could he be so nice to her?
Of course, she understood that he had done what
any physician would have done in treating the
wound, although he might have called Lewis
Somerville to do the extremely objectionable part
of the process of cleaning the bite. Since Lewis
was a cousin and in the mountains as protector to
her and her sisters, it might have been up to him
to render first aid, since the tendon Achilles is so
situated that it would take a contortionist to administer
treatment to oneself. If Dr. Wright
had only done his duty as laid down in the code of
medical ethics, he certainly had a wonderfully
pleasing sick room manner and his patients must
one and all give him praise for sympathy and
understanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gwen done promised me&rsquo;n Josh to have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
gingerbread made by the time we gits back from
hiking,&rdquo; broke in Bobby. &ldquo;I is a-hopin&rsquo; that all
this joltin&rsquo; is gonter shake down my lunch some,
&rsquo;cause sho&rsquo;s you&rsquo;s born I don&rsquo;t want what I done
et. If Josephus stumbles agin I reckon my stomick
will growl an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;m most sho&rsquo; I kin hole a
leetle mo&rsquo; if it&rsquo;s gingerbread. Gwen kin make
the bes&rsquo;es&rsquo; an&rsquo; sof&rsquo;es&rsquo; an&rsquo; blackes&rsquo; gingerbread
what I ever et.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the mention of Gwen, Helen&rsquo;s thoughts
went back to the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge where her father
had met such a tragic end, and the wallet she had
seen in the branches of the scrub oak tree flashed
in her mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wallet! The wallet! We forgot to get it
out of the tree,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! So we did! Somehow, other things
seemed more important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what it was. It might have been in
the Englishman&rsquo;s pocket, and when he fell down
the cliff, it might have got caught in the branches
of the scrub oak. I wish I knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camp looked very peaceful and homelike when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the hikers returned. The card players were still
at it and seemed all unconscious of the lengthening
shadows. Mrs. Tate took occasion while she
was dummy to embrace her offspring and to suggest
that she put witchhazel on her sunburned
countenance. The bachelor uncle played through
his no trump hand before he could assure himself
of his niece&rsquo;s safety. Miss Lizzie Somerville had
felt no uneasiness about the crowd, because was
not her beloved Lewis taking care of them? She
was somewhat concerned when she learned that
her favorite among the girls had sprained her
ankle but thanked her stars that it was only a
sprain and not a snake bite or something terrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a dread of snakes,&rdquo; she said as she
stood over Helen in the tent where Dr. Wright
had tenderly borne her, and where she lay on her
cot, thankful indeed to be off the sharp back of
Josephus and at rest on what was not exactly a
luxurious bed but very comfortable to her tired
bones. &ldquo;It was a blessing that Dr. Wright was
with you and could bind up your ankle so nicely.
Does it pain you much, child?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, not much! Not at all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as I said before, I am thankful it was
not a snake bite as I was sure none of you had
carried whisky with you, and that is the only
thing to use when a snake bites you, so I have
always been told. No matter what your habits
or convictions are, you must drink whisky if a
snake bites you. Am I not right, doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whisky is better than nothing, but there
are things that are better than whisky,&rdquo; smiled
the young man, wishing that Miss Somerville
would get away from the painful subject and
realizing more than ever how wise Helen had
been to conceal the real cause of her being out of
the running. &ldquo;Strychnia is the treatment of
modern science, as it is more efficacious than
whisky to keep up the pulse.&rdquo; He felt Helen&rsquo;s
pulse while he was talking, which seemed to Miss
Somerville rather unnecessary concern for a
sprained ankle, and she went off murmuring to
herself: &ldquo;&lsquo;There be three things which are too
wonderful for me, yea four, which I know not:
The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst
of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas came in, white and scared. Lewis
had broken the news to her as gently as possible,
but the sound of snake bite was a terrible one to
her young ears. She, too, remembered old Uncle
Snake-bit Peter and his withered limb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen, Helen!&rdquo; she cried and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Douglas, buck up! Dr. Wright says I
am doing splendidly and there is nothing to fear.
He did everything that could be done, and because
he was right on the spot, it was attended to
so quickly that the poison could not get into my
system. I feel fine, and mean to be up a great
deal sooner than I would if it had been just a
common sprain. We must keep it dark, though,
and not let a soul know it is anything but what
they think it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Douglas was reassured by the calm confidence
of the doctor and relieved, indeed, to see that
Helen was meaning to obey him in everything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had better stay perfectly quiet for several
days just to be sure, and I will treat the poor heel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
where I had to cauterize it. That will, of course,
be sore for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Helen with unaccustomed
meekness, &ldquo;but I did think I might get up to-morrow.
But I&rsquo;ll be good as I want to get well,
perfectly well, so I can go to the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge
again and get the wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would you venture there again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! But next time I&rsquo;ll wear high shoes
and leggins and look where I step. I think I deserve
some of Aunt Mandy&rsquo;s black snake whip as
a punishment. I do wish I knew what was in
that wallet&mdash;if it was a wallet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor smiled and left the tent to the sisters,
who clung to each other with all the affection
they had. They realized what they meant to one
another more than they ever had before, now that
this thing had occurred that might have proved
very serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let a soul know what the trouble
is, Douglas. Of course, you realize it would send
our week-end boarders anywhere but to the
mountains.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see it would, just the way they all talk
about snakes. I tell you one thing, though&mdash;we
must make leggins obligatory for hikers. Maybe
it would be well to order a few extra pair when
we order the blankets for those persons, like Tillie
Wingo, who will not do what they are told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe so, too. And now, honey, please get
Gwen to bring me something very simple for my
supper. I believe I&rsquo;ll join the bread and milk club
to-night and not try to eat anything heavy. I
feel so sleepy I can hardly keep my eyes open. I
do hope I am not going to dream about snakes.
I&rsquo;d sleep better if I only knew what was in the
wallet I saw hanging in the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="f8">THE QUEST.</span></h2>


<p>Perhaps Helen might have slept better had she
known what was in the wallet, but it would have
been difficult. Dr. Wright, accompanied by
Douglas, crept silently into the tent just before
the camp broke up for the night and found her
pulse absolutely normal. His patient was sleeping
so peacefully that he sought his hammock
thoroughly contented with the treatment he had
administered in the first case of snake bite that
he had met in his practice.</p>

<p>Dawn was in the neighborhood of four o&rsquo;clock.
It was so still it seemed impossible that thirty
persons were camping on that mountain side. The
night noises had ceased. Katy-dids and tree-frogs,
who had been making as much clatter as
though they had been getting out a morning paper,
had gone home to rest until it should be time
to commence on the next edition.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>This lull between night and morning lasted
only a few moments and then there was &ldquo;the earliest
pipe of half-awakened birds.&rdquo; At the first
sleepy note, Dr. Wright stirred in the hammock
which he had stretched tightly between two giant
pines a little way from the camp. He had told
himself he was to awake at dawn, and now that
he had done it, what was it all about? He lay
still for a few moments drowsily drinking in the
beauties of the dawn. A mocking bird had constituted
himself waker-up of the bird kingdom
since he could speak all languages. He now began
to call the different bird notes and was sleepily
answered from bush and tree. When he felt
that a sufficient number was awake to make it
worth his while, he burst into a great hymn of
praise and thanksgiving; at least that was what
it seemed to the young doctor, the only human
being awake on that mountain side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to join you, old fellow, I&rsquo;m so thankful
that Helen is safe,&rdquo; and then he remembered why
he had set himself the task of waking at dawn.</p>

<p>He slid from his hammock and in a short while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was taking the trail of the day before, back to
the Devil&rsquo;s Gorge. It seemed but a short walk
to the athletic young man as he swung his long
legs, delighting in the exercise. He reached the
gorge in much less than half the time it had taken
the hikers of yesterday.</p>

<p>The morning light was clear and luminous but
the gorge was as gruesome as ever. Sun light
never penetrated its gloom, and Dr. Wright noticed
that no birds seemed to sing there. He let
himself carefully down the cliff, practicing what
he had preached and looking where he stepped.
In the exact spot where Helen had jumped, he
saw a snake coiled as though waiting for another
pretty little gray shoe to come his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be the same snake,&rdquo; muttered the
young man, &ldquo;but I am going to presume it is
and kill him if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was standing on the ledge where Helen had
been when she called to Lewis Somerville, just
before the fatal leap. The wallet was in plain
view, caught in a crotch of the scrub oak, and the
hateful snake was curled up directly under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
tree as though put there by some evil magician
to guard a secret treasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look at me with your wicked eyes.
I am going to kill you if I can, and why, I don&rsquo;t
know, because I believe in a way you have done
me a pretty good turn. Helen trusts me now, at
least!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised a great bowlder over his head and
with a sure aim hurled it down on the serpent,
who was even then making his strange rattle like
dry leaves in the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was your swan song, old boy,&rdquo; and so
it was. The snake was crushed by the blow, only
his tail sticking out, twitching feebly, the rattle
vibrating slowly, making a faint lonesome sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take this for a souvenir!&rdquo; The
doctor got out one of his ever ready instruments
and deftly extracted the rattle from the now
harmless reptile. &ldquo;Some day we may laugh over
this,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t know why this made him blush
as it did, there all by himself in the Devil&rsquo;s
Gorge.</p>

<p>The rattle in his pocket, he started back up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
cliff, when he suddenly remembered his quest.
&ldquo;Well, by Jove, it looks as though that mysterious
wallet was destined to be left in the branches of
the dwarf oak!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he made his
way back down to the spot and this time got the
leather wallet. It was very tightly wedged into
the tree, in fact, it had become incorporated, as
it were, into the growth of the tree, and one of
the gnarled and twisted limbs had to be cut away
before he could free the object of his morning
walk.</p>

<p>It was a bulky pocket-book, made of alligator
skin which, because of its toughness, had evidently
been able to withstand the weather that
Dr. Wright felt sure it must have had to undergo
for years, judging by the way the branches of
the tree had grown around it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t open it now, but will take it to Helen.
It was her find and I am not going to jump her
claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The camp was stirring when he returned.
Much shouting from the bath-house assured him
that the boys were undergoing a shower of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
freezing mountain water. He waited until the
last glowing, damp-haired youth filed out and
then took a sprinkle himself, which refreshed him
greatly but left him so hungry that the delightful
odors from the open air kitchen almost maddened
him. Roe herring he was sure of,&mdash;that
is always unmistakable; hot rolls were holding
their own in the riot of smells; bacon was asserting
itself; there was a burnt sugar effect that
must mean fried June apples; and threading its
way through the symphony of fragrance and rising
supreme over all was a coffee motive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you blame any one for stealing food when
he is hungry?&rdquo; he asked Gwen, whom he found
in the pavilion setting the tables. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been up a long time, sir. I saw
you a little after four on the trail near Aunt
Mandy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you up then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. I always get up early to milk
and put the cabin in order before I come over
here. It will be a little while before breakfast.
Shall I get you a cup of coffee now?&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be very kind of you! I am famished,
and perhaps a cup of coffee would keep
me from disgracing myself when breakfast is
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gwen had changed a great deal in the few
weeks since she had come so shyly from behind
the bowlder to offer herself as factotum to Lewis
and Bill. She still had the modest demeanor, but
had lost her extreme shyness and also much of
her primness. She was now a more natural girl
of fourteen, thanks to Nan and Lucy, who had
tried to make her feel at home with them.
Shoes and stockings had helped her to recover
from her timidity. She had always had an idea
that people were looking at her bare feet. Over
her skimpy little dress she now wore a bungalow
apron, which was vastly becoming to her Puritan
type of beauty. The first money she made had
been spent on shoes and aprons. Helen had
wanted to present her with these things, but
Gwen and Josh were alike in wanting nothing
they had not honestly earned.</p>

<p>As the girl came towards the doctor, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in her steady little brown hands a tray with a
smoking cup of coffee and a hot buttered roll,
just to tide him over until breakfast, he thought
he had never seen a more attractive child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t because she was feeding me,
either,&rdquo; he said to Helen later on, &ldquo;but because
she had such a fine upstanding look to her and
because her hand was so capable and steady and
her gaze so open and honest. No great lady,
trained in the social graces, could have handed
one a cup of coffee with more assurance and
ease of manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Helen was asking for you,&rdquo; said Gwen,
as she put down the delectable tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is she all right?&rdquo; and the physician
jumped up, ready to leave his untasted food if
he were needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she is as well as can be, and when I
took her some coffee early this morning, she told
me she had slept so well and was famished for
food. I am going to straighten up her tent just
as soon as the girls are out of it, so you can go
in to see her. I told her I had seen you taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
a walk at four o&rsquo;clock. She wants to see
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if heavenly messengers wear blue
aprons and tennis shoes,&rdquo; the young man said
to himself, &ldquo;because if they do, I am sure Gwen
is one of them.&rdquo; He patted his breast pocket to
make sure the bulky wallet was there, hoping
it held in some way good for the little English
girl but determined to say nothing about it until
Helen had her first peep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it be possible that I am falling in love
with Helen?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She is not more
than seventeen, and, besides, it was only yesterday
that I determined never to put myself in the
way of being insulted by her again so long as I
should live. Here I am starving to death (this
roll and coffee will be only a drop in the bucket
of my great appetite) and still I&rsquo;d rather go see
her than eat the breakfast I can smell cooking.
I promised the father and mother to look after
the children while they were taking my prescription,
and this is a fine way to do it: to fall in
love with one of them! Besides, Helen is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
bit prettier than Douglas, not so clever as Nan,
and so spoiled that she can be certainly very disagreeable,
but still&mdash;still&mdash;she is Helen&mdash;and
Bobby loves her best of all. Anyhow, I think
I&rsquo;ll eat my breakfast first before I go to her, since
she does not need my professional services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never see folks eat like these here week-enders,&rdquo;
declared Oscar, as breakfast progressed
and he came to the kitchen for more hot rolls. He
also brought directions from Douglas for Susan
to scramble a dish of eggs for some of the late
comers who found nothing but herring tails for
their portion of a dish ever dear to the heart of
all Virginians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how the young ladies &rsquo;spects to
clar nothin&rsquo; out&rsquo;n their ventur&rsquo;some if&rsquo;n all the
payin&rsquo; guests eats ekal to these here,&rdquo; said Susan,
as she took another pan of rolls out of the oven
and put a skillet on the stove to get hot for the
eggs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s done been to many springs an&rsquo; sich
with Mis Carter when I was a-nussin&rsquo; of Bobby
an&rsquo; I never yet seed any of the pr&rsquo;ietors knock
up a dish er eggs fer no sleepy haids. Fus&rsquo; come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
fus&rsquo; serve, an&rsquo; las&rsquo; come satisfy theyselves with
herrin&rsquo; tails an&rsquo; coffee drugs. Miss Gwen done
made three pots er coffee already an&rsquo; she mought
jes&rsquo; as well be pourin&rsquo; it down the bottomless pit
fer all the showin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s done made. If&rsquo;n these
folks is gonter eat all mornin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d like ter know
whin we&rsquo;s ter git the dishes washed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dey won&rsquo;t need no scrapin&rsquo;,&rdquo; laughed
Oscar, as he bore away the plates heaped with
crusty turnovers. &ldquo;I been a-bettin&rsquo; on Mr. Bill
Tinsley, but looks lak Dr. Wright kin hole his
own with the bes&rsquo; of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing sho,&rdquo; grumbled Susan, who had the
customary bad humor of the Sunday morning
cook, &ldquo;th&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no use&rsquo;n a clock up&rsquo;n in this here
camp. Whin you gits through with breakfast,
it&rsquo;s time ter begin dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="f8">THE WALLET.</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Did you sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a top!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad dreams?&rdquo; and Dr. Wright felt the pulse
of the healthy looking patient, who, with the help
of Gwen, had donned a very becoming boudoir
cap and negligée, two articles of clothing that she
had brought to camp in spite of the jeerings of
her sisters, who did not see how they could be
used. Helen had not had an illness since she was
a child and had her tonsils out, and certainly a
camp was no place to sport a filmy lace cap and
a negligée of pale blue silk and lace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is almost worth while having a sn&mdash;having
a sprained ankle just to prove to my sisters that
I was wise in bringing this cap and sacque,&rdquo; she
had laughingly told Gwen, who was assisting her.
&ldquo;I bet snake bite is going to come popping out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of my mouth, willy nilly,&rdquo; she said to herself.
&ldquo;I almost gave it away that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gwen, who loved pretty things and scented
from afar the admiration Dr. Wright was beginning
to hold for Helen, considered it very wise
to have brought the dainty garments. She could
not help thinking, with something akin to bitterness,
of her own yellow cotton night gowns that
Aunt Mandy considered superfluous articles of
clothing; and of the coarse, gray flannel bed-sacque
she had worn the summer before when
she had caught the measles from Josh; and of
how she must have looked when the old country
doctor came to see her.</p>

<p>The tent was tidy and sweet when George
Wright entered to see how his patient fared.
Gwen had spread the steamer rugs over the cots
and had even placed a bunch of honeysuckle on
the little table at Helen&rsquo;s bedside. She had had
to purloin the table from Miss Somerville&rsquo;s cabin,
but that lady was willing to give up more than a
table for her favorite young cousin.</p>

<p>Helen blushed a little when the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
asked her if she had had any bad dreams. The
fact was she had had very pleasant dreams in
which he had largely figured. She had dreamed
that Josephus had turned into Pegasus and that,
as she flew along on his shapely back, she had
met Dr. Wright floating by on a white cloud and
he had wanted to feel her pulse. She had put
out her hand and as he felt her pulse, he had
jumped from the white cloud square onto the
back of Pegasus, and together they rode through
the air, the winged horse looking kindly on them
with much the benevolent expression of Josephus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dreams were pleasant,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>

<p>Dr. Wright certainly took a long time to feel
any one&rsquo;s pulse, but the truth was that he had
forgotten to count, so taken up he was with the
fact that pale blue was quite as becoming to Helen
as gray with a dash of scarlet. I think if he
had felt his own pulse, he would have been astonished
at how far from normal his heart beats
were at that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought you the wallet from the Devil&rsquo;s
Gorge. Here it is for you to open!&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dr. Wright! Is that where you were
going when Gwen saw you so early this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are very good to take that tramp
for Gwen,&rdquo; she said, taking the bulky wallet in
her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take it for Gwen, but for you.&rdquo; Gwen
had left the tent for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you would have done it for Gwen, I am
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, but perhaps not on an empty
stomach,&rdquo; laughed the doctor. &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t
you open the pocketbook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is Gwen&rsquo;s! She must be the one
to open it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not sure it is hers. I brought it
for you to have the pleasure of opening it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure it is hers, and I&rsquo;d take more
pleasure in seeing her open it than doing it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Gwen returned with a pitcher of
fresh water. Helen held up the wallet and said:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see this before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gwen turned pale and her steady little hands,
that could usually carry a brimming cup of coffee
safely to its destination without once slopping
over, shook so that she spilled the water from
the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Helen! Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind now where we found it! You
open it and see if you can identify it,&rdquo; said Helen
kindly. She realized that Gwen was to have excitement
enough in opening this wallet of her
father&rsquo;s, lost as it had been for five years, without
having to picture, as she would surely do,
his death, the fall from the cliff and this pocketbook
slipping from his coat and lodging in the
tree.</p>

<p>The wallet was evidently an expensive one:
alligator skin lined with Russian leather. The
silver clasp was rusty and Gwen&rsquo;s trembling
hands could hardly force the sliding catch, but
Helen motioned for Dr. Wright not to assist her.
She felt, somehow, that the girl would rather
do it all herself. They were silent while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
little English girl fumbled the lock and finally
sprung it. The wallet was stuffed full of papers
and letters. In one compartment was some silver,
several gold pieces and some English coins.
The papers were yellow with age, but so stout
was the alligator skin that the many rains that
must have fallen during the five years the wallet
had been wedged in that scrub oak&rsquo;s branches,
had not wet them nor defaced them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be very careful, Gwen, there may be all kinds
of precious documents in there,&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen, as some of the papers floated to the
floor of the tent and some fluttered to her own
cot.</p>

<p>Gwen had sunk to the floor in a little heap and
was sobbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can remember so well how my father used
to open up this pocketbook and pore over these
letters. I was never allowed to touch it. He
kept his money in it and receipts and things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, here is a receipt for one thousand dollars
in cash payment for land!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen,
as a yellow slip of paper fell on her coverlet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
The paper was written in a bold black hand so
that any one might read it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Received payment from St. John Brownell for
100 acres of land at Greendale, Albemarle
County, Va. $1,000 in cash.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Abner Dean</span>.<br /></p>
</div>

<p>The signature was in violet ink and very shaky.
Helen recognized it as old Dean&rsquo;s writing, as
when he sent up any produce to the camp from
his store at Greendale, it had been her duty to
go over the bill which invariably accompanied
the goods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Gwen, Gwen! That old wretch has
cheated you out of your land! Do you know, he
handed over to Father, for money he owed him,
land that did not belong to him, and this minute
our camp is built on your property?&rdquo; Helen was
very much excited, and as for Gwen,&mdash;she was
pale and trembling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get up out of
this bed and go horse-whip him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, can I do it for you?&rdquo; from the doctor.
&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to get a lawyer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
take the matter up and have the thing legally
adjusted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We-e-ll, ye-s! Maybe&mdash;&mdash; But I&rsquo;d certainly
like to make that old man suffer some. Wouldn&rsquo;t
you, Gwen?&rdquo; But the little English girl was so
busy sorting the papers that had fallen from
her father&rsquo;s old wallet that she did not hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that in the back of the pocketbook
where the other fastening is?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money and more money! Why, Gwen, look
at the bills!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen was right. In a neat and orderly manner
in yet another closed compartment of the
wallet were placed greenbacks and yellowbacks
of high denominations. The girls feverishly
counted out $1,500.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder it was so fat! We had better
not say anything about having all this money
in camp. It ought to be in the bank, Gwen, as
it might be stolen from you. Dr. Wright will
deposit it for you in Richmond and you can draw
on it as you need.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Gwen handed over the bills to the young man
without a moment&rsquo;s delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait now, let&rsquo;s count it again to make sure,
and I will give you a receipt for the amount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s not necessary, is it, Miss Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; And then Helen blushed to
think how short a time had elapsed since she had
expressed all kinds of doubts about the honesty
of this man, because, forsooth, he had been given
power of attorney over a paltry $83.59! Here
she was advising this little mountain waif to
hand over to Dr. Wright what seemed to them a
large fortune without even a receipt.</p>

<p>George Wright smiled and quietly wrote a receipt
for the amount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be safer to let me carry this money
for you because it might get out that you have
it, and it would be easier to get it from you than
me. I will deposit it at the Virginia Trust Co.
in Richmond, and will send you the bank book
immediately. You can invest it or not as you
see fit. It would bring in forty-five dollars a
year if you put it in the savings bank.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be enough for me to go to
school on and even be a boarder at school! But
I want some of it to buy a new mule for Aunt
Mandy. Josephus is so old and feeble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better not tell Josh you think so,&rdquo;
laughed the doctor. &ldquo;But will you be contented,
child, just to stay on in the mountains for the
rest of your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the only home I have. Where else
can I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go wherever we are,&rdquo; cried Helen
impulsively, and Dr. Wright&rsquo;s admiration for her
was increased if possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Helen, you are so good! But
Aunt Mandy needs me and maybe if I stay
here I can make Josh wash, even in the winter
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you can,&rdquo; said the doctor kindly,
&ldquo;and it is a great thing to be needed and to see
some chance of improving your fellow man. You
could, with economy, get yourself through college
on this money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, of course, you own the land our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
camp is built on,&rdquo; remembered Helen. &ldquo;That is
a thousand dollars more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want that,&rdquo; exclaimed Gwen. &ldquo;It
has been so wonderful to have all of you here
and so good to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear child, the land belongs to you
and this Abner Dean will have to be the one to
suffer, not you or the Carters. If you will let me,
I will consult a lawyer in Richmond and have
him take hold of the matter. Don&rsquo;t you find a
deed of some sort among those papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no deed among the papers and, in
fact, one never was found. The mystery was
never solved how such an intelligent man as St.
John Brownell evidently was had contented himself
with a mere receipt for the $1,000 paid Abner
Dean. He was perhaps suffering so with the
nervous complaint which finally caused his death,
that he had accepted the simplest method which
presented itself to establish himself in a place
where he hoped to find some peace.</p>

<p>While Helen was confined to her couch with
the spurious sprained ankle, she helped Gwen unravel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the story of her life from the letters found
in the wonderful wallet. It was not such an
extraordinary story, after all. St. John Brownell
was of good family and education but evidently
of small means, being the younger son of one of
the many daughters of an impoverished earl. He
had married young, come to America, and taken
up teaching as a profession. His wife had died
and then had come on him the strange malady
that had caused him so much agony. Cities were
hateful to him and he had decided that his small
patrimony would serve best in some locality
where the living was very inexpensive. Helen
gathered from some of the letters that this patrimony
amounted to about $3,000. He seemed to
have arrived in the mountains with that much
money in cash. He had bought the one hundred
acres of land on the side of the mountain,
hoping to improve it, possibly by going into Albemarle
pippins. Gwen thought he had perhaps
put his money into cash expecting to place it in a
bank in Virginia; but as his malady gained on
him all money dealings became very hateful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
irksome to him, and he had evidently procrastinated
until he had become in the habit of just
carrying that roll of money around with him.</p>

<p>Gwen could recall nothing of her mother, but
she remembered being in a kindergarten in New
York and of course remembered coming to Virginia,
and her father&rsquo;s every characteristic was
as fresh in her mind as though he had died only
yesterday. The poor man had never been too
miserable to be anything but gentle and loving
to his little daughter, and he had spared no pains
in teaching her, so that at nine years, her age
when he had died, Gwen had been quite as well
educated as many a child of twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to write to some of your
father&rsquo;s family, Gwen?&rdquo; asked Helen, who had
become so absorbed in the research that she felt
like a full-fledged detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; and Gwen shook her head sadly.
&ldquo;He must have gone completely out of their lives.
I can&rsquo;t remember his getting any letters after
we came to Virginia. Some day, maybe, I can
make enough money to go to England, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
I will hunt them up and peep at them through
the shutters, and if they look kind and nice, I&rsquo;ll
make myself known to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right. They may be all kinds
of pills and they might come over here and take
you back with them whether you wanted to go
or not. And you might have to live in stuffy
chambers in London and never see the mountains
any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreadful! That would kill me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so Gwen went on living with kind Aunt
Mandy, little by little cleaning up that good
woman until she became reconciled to water and
almost fond of it.</p>

<p>George Wright consulted a lawyer friend who
took Gwen&rsquo;s affairs in hand and by skillful management
brought old Abner Dean to the realization
that it would be best for him to execute a
deed to the land bought by St. John Brownell,
arranging it so Gwen would own the property
without any string tied to it. He was forced to
pay the money to Mr. Carter, and then the girls,
having unwittingly built on Gwen&rsquo;s land, rented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
it from her. Land had increased twofold in value
since the Englishman had made his purchase, and
the timber had grown so there was every indication
that by careful management Gwen would
have a good deal more money to add to her bank
account.</p>

<p>Before Dr. Wright went back to Richmond, he
told Helen he had killed the snake, if not the one
who had taken a nip out of her tendon Achilles,
at least one just as good or just as bad, whichever
way she chose to look at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old snake!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen. &ldquo;He
shouldn&rsquo;t have been punished for acting according
to his nature. I am the one that should have
been punished, because I hope I acted not according
to my nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, haven&rsquo;t you been punished?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Helen said nothing. She felt in her heart that
she had not been punished at all but had been
favored, in that through that rattlesnake she had
gained a real friend in the young doctor.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<span class="f8">WHERE IS BOBBY?</span></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Where is Bobby, Helen?&rdquo; asked Douglas,
coming into the tent where Helen was having an
enforced invalidism. She had promised Dr.
Wright to be quiet until he returned to camp,
which he was planning to do in a week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to make you glad to see me and if my
coming means you are no longer in durance vile
I know I shall be welcome,&rdquo; he had said when he
told her good-by after a little more pulse taking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall always be glad to have you,&rdquo; she had
replied impersonally. He did think she might
have used a singular pronoun but he was grateful
to her for any small scrap of politeness. As
for Helen, it was difficult for her to get over a
certain sharpness of manner she had up to this
time carefully kept for the young physician.
When she had fooled herself into thinking she
hated him there had been times when she had forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to be rude in spite of her intentions and
now, when she meant to be mild and gentle, sometimes
the old habit of studied disagreeableness
got the better of her. That long week of enforced
idleness had chastened her spirit wonderfully.
She was so gentle that Douglas sometimes
thought maybe she was ill. The rattler seemed
to have extracted the poison from her system,
rather than injected it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one more day!&rdquo; she was thinking when
Douglas came in. Dr. Wright was expected on
the morrow and then she could be up and doing
once more. There were absolutely no ill effects
from the wound and that tiny excuse for a bandage
had wholly disappeared. It seemed foolish
to be nursing up herself like this, but then she
had promised and Helen Carter never broke her
word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bobby, you say? Why, he must have gone
with Josh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Josh was to go a long way for some
chickens and I thought Bobby would get too
tired.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe Lewis took him to the station with
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! I hear the goat chugging up the
mountain now. I&rsquo;ll go see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no Bobby!</p>

<p>The mountain goat was laden with packages
and two previous boarders who could not wait
for the week-end to return to camp. No one had
seen Bobby for hours and hours it developed on
investigation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He done pestered the life out&rsquo;n me all mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
declared Oscar, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I done tol&rsquo; him go fin&rsquo;
Susan and worry her some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; I sint him back to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he ain&rsquo;t never come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came to me for a story,&rdquo; confessed Nan,
&ldquo;but I was so interested in my book I couldn&rsquo;t
stop. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to go with Lil and me but we
didn&rsquo;t want him tagging on,&rdquo; and Lucy looked
ready to weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came to me and wanted me to build a log
cabin out of sticks but I had my accounts to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
over,&rdquo; groaned Douglas. &ldquo;I sent him to Helen
but she hasn&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he is around somewhere,&rdquo; comforted
Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; declared Bill. &ldquo;All hands turn out
and hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sisters all felt guilty consciences for not
having looked after their little brother, all but
Helen, who was the only one who had not seen
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the only one who had time for him and
I am the only one he didn&rsquo;t come to,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;If I only hadn&rsquo;t promised Dr. Wright to stay
still until he got here! I know I could find
Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, honey, there are lots of hunters and you
must do what the doctor told you,&rdquo; begged
Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll mind him all right&mdash;that is unless
Bobby stays lost too long and then I&rsquo;ll have to
get up and break my word if I lose my immortal
soul in the act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staying still while the hue and cry for her dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
little brother was going on was about the hardest
job Helen Carter ever undertook. She imagined
all sorts of terrible things. Maybe gypsies had
stolen him. Maybe a rattlesnake had bitten him
and he was even now dying from it. Maybe he
had fallen down the mountain side and had
dashed his brains out on some boulder. Worse
than anything he might be lost forever, wandering
over the mountains trying to find his way
home, crying and calling, scared almost to death,
tired and hungry, dying finally of starvation and
exposure.</p>

<p>Taking Bill&rsquo;s advice, all hands turned out to
hunt for the lost boy. In five minutes Helen was
the only person left in camp, even Miss Elizabeth
Somerville and the newly arrived boarders
joining in the search. There were many paths
leading from camp and up and down these the
crowd scattered.</p>

<p>Dear little Bobby! No one thought him a nuisance
now. Nan and Gwen made their way to
Aunt Mandy&rsquo;s cabin, thinking perhaps he had
gone there in search of Josh. Aunt Mandy came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
out with kindly words of discouragement and
gruesome tales of a child her mother told her of
who wandered off and never was found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there Bobby looks like a angel anyhow.
Children like him is hard to raise. We uns is
been a tellin&rsquo; of Gwen and Josh that Bobby is too
purty for a boy. He looks to we uns more like
a gal angel.&rdquo; Gwen tried to stop her but the old
woman went on until Nan was almost in tears.
If she had not been so distressed she would have
found this amusing, but with Bobby gone for
hours a sense of humor did not help much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gwen! Where can he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep on down this path for a while. He
and Josh often go this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Josh would only come! I know he could
find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be found soon, I am sure. His little
legs cannot carry him very far and I am sure he
would not get out of the trails. He may be back
at camp now. You turn back and let me follow
this trail for a mile or so. You are tired, I
know.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I&rsquo;m not; if I were it would serve
me right. If only I had stopped and told him a
story! I am so selfish when I get steeped in a
book. What will Mother say if Bobby is lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I am sure we will find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls wandered on, stopping every now and
then to call to the lost child. Sometimes they
would be answered by an echo and then would
stop and listen and call again.</p>

<p>Douglas got in the car with Lewis, who
whisked her down the mountain side to the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he has carried out his threat of running
away. He is always saying he is going back
to Richmond when he gets tired of the camp,
which he does occasionally when he has nothing
to occupy him. If I had only stopped adding up
expenses and built the log cabin for him! I have
neglected him, I am sure&mdash;and what will Father
and Mother say? I wish I had let him go
with Josh. He always takes such good care of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to find him, Douglas, I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
sure. Why, the little shaver could not walk very
far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not at the station and no one had seen
him. Old Abner Dean came out of his store and
actually seemed to feel some concern for the boy.
He was a hard old man but not hard enough to
resist the charm of Bobby&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could not have come to the station without
some one seeing him, and now I am going to take
you home. He may be found by this time and if
he is not I&rsquo;ll start out again. There is no use in
your going,&rdquo; said Lewis, feeling very sorry for
the distracted sister and very uneasy himself in
spite of his repeated assurances to Douglas that
the little shaver was all right wherever he might
be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First let&rsquo;s go down this road a little way. He
might have turned off before he got to the station.
He knows that this is the road Josephus and Josh
took this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! Anywhere that there is a chance
of finding him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucy and Lil with Frank and his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Skeeter, went over the mountain. Lucy and Lil
were feeling very much cut up that they had refused
to let poor little Bobby tag along earlier
in the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have taken him with me,&rdquo; wailed
Lucy. &ldquo;Maybe I can never take care of him
again. S&rsquo;pose wild cats get him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they wouldn&rsquo;t attack in daylight,&rdquo; declared
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we might not find him before dark and
wolves and snakes and wild cats and all kinds of
things might get him. I promised Mother I&rsquo;d be
good to him, too.&rdquo; Lucy was sniffing dismally
and Lil joined her friend in her demonstration of
woe.</p>

<p>They came to the reservoir where Bobby loved
to play and was not allowed to come alone. It
was not deep but then a little child does not need
much water to drown in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so clear that if he is in the bottom we
can see him, that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo; suggested
Skeeter, but the rest of them could not extract
much joy from the fact.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am scared to look in!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucy, hiding
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing in there but a bullfrog,&rdquo; reassured
Frank, so they left the reservoir and climbed on
up the mountain.</p>

<p>Susan and Oscar took the path around the
mountain. The two devoted servants were so
deeply concerned about their darling Bobby, very
precious now that he was lost, that they felt there
was no way to express their concern but by quarreling
with each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whin I sint him to you, why&rsquo;n you keep
keer er him?&rdquo; grumbled Oscar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherefore you didn&rsquo;t keep keer er him yo&rsquo;
se&rsquo;f?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no nuss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me neither! I done hi&rsquo;ed out fur a housemaid.
I is demeanin&rsquo; of my rightful oaths to be
adoin&rsquo; what I is. If the haid of our sassiety
should git wind of all the occupations I is a occupying
I ain&rsquo;t got a doubt she would read me out in
meetin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, nobody ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; to blow &rsquo;bout what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
wuck you does but yo&rsquo;se&rsquo;f. I can&rsquo;t see but what
you keeps to yo&rsquo; vows well enough. If lookin&rsquo; after
chillums aint &rsquo;ooman&rsquo;s wuck I lak to know
what is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every now and then they stopped their wrangling
to shout for the lost boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bo&mdash;oob&mdash;by! You, Bo&mdash;oob&mdash;by! I got
some ca&mdash;an&mdash;dy fur yer,&rdquo; called Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Andyfuryer!&rdquo; came back from the next
mountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar he is!&rdquo; declared Oscar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thar he is much! That there is what Miss
Nan calls a ego. It&rsquo;s some kind er a beast I
reckon what mocks folks. Sounds lak hants ter
me. I done dream of trouble last night anyhow.
I dream I was a gittin&rsquo; married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would sho&rsquo; be trouble to the groom,&rdquo;
chuckled Oscar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dream book says that dreamin&rsquo; of marriage
is sho sign er death. I reckon our little
Bobby is dead by this time. Out here cold and
starved in the mountings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he done et a good breakfast this mornin&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and ain&rsquo;t starved yit as &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t time ter dish up
dinner yit. An&rsquo; if he is cold I&rsquo;d lak ter know whar
he done foun&rsquo; a cool spot. I sho is a sweatin&rsquo;
myse&rsquo;f.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go &rsquo;long, you ole nigger! You ain&rsquo;t got no
feelin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s got as much feelin&rsquo; as you is but I&rsquo;s got
enough ter worry &rsquo;bout without makin&rsquo; up
troubles. I want ter find that there Bobby an&rsquo; I
feel turrible bad &rsquo;bout his a gittin&rsquo; lost but I ain&rsquo;t
agoin&rsquo; ter trouble my haid about his bein&rsquo; cold and
hongry whin the sun is a shinin&rsquo; down on my back
as hot as a mustard plarster an&rsquo; I done see the
boy put away two full batches of waffles with
enough scrambled eggs to feed a whole fambly.
His appletite done pick up wonderful sense we
been a campin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth Somerville had to help in the
search, too, although Bill Tinsley tried to persuade
her that he and Tillie Wingo could do her
part and she had better go back to the pavilion,
but go she would down the rocky path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
but the rod of correction shall drive it far from
him,&rsquo;&rdquo; she declaimed grimly. &ldquo;If I had my way
I should give that child a good whipping when he
is found. He knows perfectly well he should not
have gone off without asking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The search kept up for more than an hour and
still no sign of little Bobby. Even the most cheerfully
sanguine of the campers began to feel dubious.
Helen lay on her cot in an agony of suspense.
The search party had none of them returned.
She began to fear that the worst might
have happened to her beloved little brother. If
she could only get up and help! She regretted
the promise she had made Dr. Wright. How
could she stay still until the next day? She knew
she could find Bobby if any one could. Did he not
love her best of all the sisters? How strange
that he had not come to her when Douglas sent
him! She would have told him stories and
amused him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he did come while I was taking that
little nap,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It was only for a moment
that I dozed off and usually he is quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
enough to awaken any one who is sleeping.&rdquo; The
truth of the matter was that Bobby was loath to
have anybody sleep. He was famous as a waker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a car! I hear it coming up the mountain.
I do hope it is Douglas and she has got
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waited what seemed hours but was in
reality but a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Lewis! Somebody!
Have you found him?&rdquo; Her voice rang out very
loud in the empty camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; Dr. Wright&rsquo;s voice just
outside her tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dr. Wright! Bobby is lost! May I get
up and help hunt? I&rsquo;m so glad you have come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I. I was called to Charlottesville in
consultation and came on up here for a visit.
Tell me about Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been lost for hours and hours. Everybody
is out hunting and I promised I&rsquo;d stay here
until you came, but oh, Dr. Wright, it has been
hard to keep my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor little girl! But you mustn&rsquo;t worry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Bobby can take care of himself anywhere he happens
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I can!&rdquo; came from under Helen&rsquo;s cot
and then a tousled sleepy little figure followed
the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bobby, Bobby!&rdquo; cried Helen, hugging the
little wretch close in her arms. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know
we were nearly scared to death about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope! How&rsquo;s I to know? I drap off to sleep,
I reckon. I was so tired er gettin&rsquo; driv from one
to the tother all mornin&rsquo; that I got so sleepy I
couldn&rsquo;t stay awake. When I got driv to you by
Douglas and found you snoozin&rsquo; I jes&rsquo; crawled in
under your bed and must a snoozed some myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of his being right here all the time!
Please go tell the rest he is found. Tell them I
found him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell &rsquo;em Helen is wuth mor&rsquo;n all of them
put together. She kin do more findin&rsquo; of things
lyin&rsquo; up in the bed than all the crowd can a huntin&rsquo;
all over the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bobby soon became the center of attraction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Everybody had to give him a hug and everybody
was sorry they had &ldquo;driv&rdquo; him off. Douglas
promised him an Indian outfit; Nan promised to
tell him all the stories she knew; Lucy invited him
to tag along with her whenever he wanted to;
Lewis Somerville gave him a new knife if he
promised never to use it unless Josh was with
him to pick up the pieces he cut off himself;
Susan immediately put on some molasses to cook
for an always welcome candy pulling; Oscar gave
him an especial invitation to a chicken picking
he was to hold that afternoon.</p>

<p>Helen was allowed to get up by the cautious
young doctor since the snake bite was entirely
gone. Her manner to him was so gentle he could
not help feeling that he himself, as well as a
physician who was releasing her, was welcome to
the camp.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this visit Dr. Wright found much food
for thought&mdash;serious and otherwise. As he
watched the Carter girls, happily active in their
daily tasks, bravely puzzling over their problems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
in economy, unselfishly entertaining their week-end
guests, he contrasted their life on the side of
the mountain in Albemarle with the sheltered
existence they had known&mdash;and marveled and rejoiced.</p>

<p>The summer was doing wonderful things for
all the members of the camping party. Miss
Somerville had seen a sunrise and had waxed enthusiastic
over it. Susan had learned to sleep
with her windows open and to realize that some
of her dreams were indicative of what had happened
rather than what was going to happen.
Namely! a fearful dream she had had of fresh
meat did not mean sure death, as the dream book
said, but that she had eaten too much beefsteak
the night before. Oscar had learned that there
was a lot of good in po&rsquo; whites when once they
began to wash. Josh, in turn, had learned the
value of cold water on character as well as hide.</p>

<p>Lewis Somerville and his chum, Bill, had
learned the power of honest toil to assuage the
mental anguish they had had to contend with because
of their interrupted careers. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
planning for the future instead of looking back
and regretting the past. Bobby was learning
more than any of the party. He had learned
how to find a bee tree and where the sparrow
hawk nests; he had learned how to skin up any
tree he could get his arms around and how to
slide down without barking his shins; he had
learned how to scrooch up his toes when the path
was stony and not hurt his feet walking in briars.
Josh was his tutor and had even taught him when
to say we uns and you allses. Josephus had
learned where to go for lump sugar, and whenever
Helen appeared, the old mule limped after
her, putting his head on one side and singing
like a canary bird; at least, that was what Nan
said he did.</p>

<p>So even Josephus could be numbered among
those who had benefited by the healthful, unselfish,
out-of-door life on the mountain side. Lucy,
perhaps, of all the Carter girls, had changed the
least under the new influences. Her attitude
toward the world in general and Helen in particular
remained about the same: she was adoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and belligerent, imitative and rebellious, as variable
as a weather vane in March.</p>

<p>The fact that Helen had been bitten by a snake
was carefully kept from Lucy for fear she would
go do likewise. She tried very hard to stay in
bed one day with a would-be sprained ankle, but
the delights of the mountains were too alluring.
She hobbled out of bed before the day was over
and by evening was fox trotting with Skeeter,
who, by the way, had answered Frank Maury&rsquo;s
letter in person by return mail.</p>

<p>But if Lucy took the business end of the summer
venture lightly, Douglas, Helen and Nan
shouldered its responsibilities seriously and gloried
in its success. Their enthusiasm did not wane
nor did their determination falter: their father
should not be burdened by debts on his home-coming.</p>

<p>How they clung to their purpose and how they
met the remaining experiences of the summer,
their friends may discover, if they will, in &ldquo;The
Carter Girls&rsquo; Week-End Camp.&rdquo;</p>
